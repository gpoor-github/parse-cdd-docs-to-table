<p>See Section <a href="#2_2_1_hardware">2.2.1</a> for device-specific requirements.</p>

<h3 id="711_media_performance_class" data-text="7.11. Media Performance Class">7.11. Media Performance Class</h3>

<p>The media performance class of the device implementation can be obtained from
the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.MEDIA_PERFORMANCE_CLASS</code>. Requirements for
media performance class are defined for each Android version starting with
R (version 30). The special value of 0 designates that the device is not of a
media performance class.</p>

<p>If device implementations return non-zero value for
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.MEDIA_PERFORMANCE_CLASS</code>, they:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[C-1-1] MUST return at least a value of <code translate="no" dir="ltr">android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.R</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>[C-1-2] MUST be a handheld device implementation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See Section 2.2.7 for device-specific requirements.</p>

<p>Some minimum performance and power criteria are critical to the user experience
and impact the baseline assumptions developers would have when developing an
app.</p>

<h3 id="81_user_experience_consistency" data-text="8.1. User Experience Consistency">8.1. User Experience Consistency</h3>

<p>A smooth user interface can be provided to the end user if there are certain
minimum requirements to ensure a consistent frame rate and response times for
applications and games. Device implementations, depending on the device type,
MAY have measurable requirements for the user interface latency and task
switching as described in <a href="#2_device-types">section 2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="82_file_io_access_performance" data-text="8.2. File I/O Access Performance">8.2. File I/O Access Performance</h3>

<p>Providing a common baseline for a consistent file access performance on the
application private data storage (<code translate="no" dir="ltr">/data</code> partition) allows app developers
to set a proper expectation that would help their software design. Device
implementations, depending on the device type, MAY have certain requirements
described in <a href="#2_device-type">section 2</a> for the following read
and write operations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sequential write performance</strong>. Measured by writing a 256MB file using
10MB write buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Random write performance</strong>. Measured by writing a 256MB file using 4KB
write buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Sequential read performance</strong>. Measured by reading a 256MB file using
10MB write buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Random read performance</strong>. Measured by reading a 256MB file using 4KB
write buffer.</li>
</ul>
