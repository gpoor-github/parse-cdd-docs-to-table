Media Codec Security  Device implementations MUST ensure compliance with media codec security features as described below.  Android includes support for OMX, a cross-platform multimedia acceleration API, as well as Codec 2.0, a low-overhead multimedia acceleration API.  If device implementations support multimedia, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST provide support for media codecs either via OMX or Codec 2.0 APIs (or both) as in the Android Open Source Project and not disable or circumvent the security protections. This specifically does not mean that every codec MUST use either the OMX or Codec 2.0 API, only that support for at least one of these APIs MUST be available, and support for the available APIs MUST include the security protections present. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to include support for Codec 2.0 API.  If device implementations do not support the Codec 2.0 API, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST include the corresponding OMX software codec from the Android Open Source Project (if it is available) for each media format and type (encoder or decoder) supported by the device. *   [C-2-2] Codecs that have names starting with ""OMX.google."" MUST be based on their Android Open Source Project source code. *   [C-SR]  Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the OMX software codecs run in a codec process that does not have access to hardware drivers other than memory mappers.  If device implementations support Codec 2.0 API, they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST include the corresponding Codec 2.0 software codec from the Android Open Source Project (if it is available) for each media format and type (encoder or decoder) supported by the device. *   [C-3-2] MUST house the Codec 2.0 software codecs in the software codec process as provided in the Android Open Source Project to make it possible to more narrowly grant access to software codecs. *   [C-3-3] Codecs that have names starting with ""c2.android."" MUST be based on their Android Open Source Project source code.  ### 5.1.10\. Media Codec Characterization  If device implementations support media codecs, they:  *  [C-1-1] MUST return correct values of media codec characterization via the    [`MediaCodecInfo`](    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodecInfo)    API.  In particular:  *  [C-1-2] Codecs with names starting with ""OMX."" MUST use the OMX APIs and have names that conform to OMX IL naming guidelines. *  [C-1-3] Codecs with names starting with ""c2."" MUST use the Codec 2.0 API and have names that conform to Codec 2.0 naming guidelines for Android. *  [C-1-4] Codecs with names starting with ""OMX.google."" or ""c2.android."" MUST NOT be characterized as vendor or as hardware-accelerated. *  [C-1-5] Codecs that run in a codec process (vendor or system) that have access to hardware drivers other than memory allocators and mappers MUST NOT be characterized as software-only. *  [C-1-6] Codecs not present in the Android Open Source Project or not based on the source code in that project MUST be characterized as vendor. *  [C-1-7] Codecs that utilize hardware acceleration MUST be characterized as hardware accelerated. *  [C-1-8] Codec names MUST NOT be misleading. For example, codecs named ""decoders"" MUST support decoding, and those named ""encoders"" MUST support encoding. Codecs with names containing media formats MUST support those formats.  If device implementations support video codecs:  *  [C-2-1] All video codecs MUST publish achievable frame rate data for the following sizes if supported by the codec:  <table>   <tr>     <th></th>     <th>SD (low quality)</th>     <th>SD (high quality)</th>     <th>HD 720p</th>     <th>HD 1080p</th>     <th>UHD</th>   </tr>   <tr>     <th>Video resolution</th>     <td><ul>     <li class=""table_list"">176 x 144 px (H263, MPEG2, MPEG4)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">352 x 288 px (MPEG4 encoder, H263, MPEG2)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">320 x 180 px (VP8, VP8)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">320 x 240 px (other)</li></ul>     </td>     <td><ul>     <li class=""table_list"">704 x 576 px (H263)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">640 x 360 px (VP8, VP9)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">640 x 480 px (MPEG4 encoder)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">720 x 480 px (other)</li></ul>     </td>     <td><ul>     <li class=""table_list"">1408 x 1152 px (H263)</li>     <li class=""table_list"">1280 x 720 px (other)</li></ul>     </td>     <td>1920 x 1080 px (other than MPEG4)</td>     <td>3840 x 2160 px (HEVC, VP9)</td>   </tr> </table>  *  [C-2-2] Video codecs that are characterized as hardware accelerated MUST publish performance points information. They MUST each list all supported standard performance points (listed in [`PerformancePoint`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodecInfo.VideoCapabilities) API), unless they are covered by another supported standard performance point. *  Additionally they SHOULD publish extended performance points if they support sustained video performance other than one of the standard ones listed.

"5_6_audio-latency"	"5.6"	""	"05060000.48"	"5.6"	"""## 5.6\. Audio Latency  Audio latency is the time delay as an audio signal passes through a system. Many classes of applications rely on short latencies, to achieve real-time sound effects.  For the purposes of this section, use the following definitions:  *   **output latency**. The interval between when an application writes a frame of PCM-coded data and when the corresponding sound is presented to environment at an on-device transducer or signal leaves the device via a port and can be observed externally. *   **cold output latency**. The output latency for the first frame, when the audio output system has been idle and powered down prior to the request. *   **continuous output latency**. The output latency for subsequent frames, after the device is playing audio. *   **input latency**. The interval between when a sound is presented by environment to device at an on-device transducer or signal enters the device via a port and when an application reads the corresponding frame of PCM-coded data. *   **lost input**. The initial portion of an input signal that is unusable or unavailable. *   **cold input latency**. The sum of lost input time and the input latency for the first frame, when the audio input system has been idle and powered down prior to the request. *   **continuous input latency**. The input latency for subsequent frames, while the device is capturing audio. *   **cold output jitter**. The variability among separate measurements of cold output latency values. *   **cold input jitter**. The variability among separate measurements of cold input latency values. *   **continuous round-trip latency**. The sum of continuous input latency plus continuous output latency plus one buffer period. The buffer period allows time for the app to process the signal and time for the app to mitigate phase difference between input and output streams. *   **OpenSL ES PCM buffer queue API**. The set of PCM-related [OpenSL ES](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/audio/opensl/index.html) APIs within [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html). *   **AAudio native audio API**. The set of [AAudio](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/audio/aaudio/aaudio.html) APIs within [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html). *   **Timestamp**. A pair consisting of a relative frame position within a stream and the estimated time when that frame enters or leaves the audio processing pipeline on the associated endpoint.  See also [AudioTimestamp](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTimestamp). *   **glitch**. A temporary interruption or incorrect sample value in the audio signal, typically caused by a [buffer underrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_underrun) for output, buffer overrun for input, or any other source of digital or analog noise.  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.audio.output`, they MUST meet or exceed the following requirements:  *   [C-1-1] The output timestamp returned by [AudioTrack.getTimestamp](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack.html#getTimestamp(android.media.AudioTimestamp)) and `AAudioStream_getTimestamp` is accurate to +/- 2 ms. *   [C-1-2] Cold output latency of 500 milliseconds or less.  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.audio.output` they are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet or exceed the following requirements:  *   [C-SR] Cold output latency of 100 milliseconds or less. Existing and new     devices that run this version of Android are VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED     to meet these requirements now. In a future platform release in 2021, we     will require Cold output latency of 200 ms or less as a MUST. *   [C-SR] Continuous output latency of 45 milliseconds or less. *   [C-SR] Minimize the cold output jitter. *   [C-SR] The output timestamp returned by [AudioTrack.getTimestamp](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack.html#getTimestamp(android.media.AudioTimestamp)) and `AAudioStream_getTimestamp` is accurate to +/- 1 ms.  If device implementations meet the above requirements, after any initial calibration, when using both the OpenSL ES PCM buffer queue and AAudio native audio APIs, for continuous output latency and cold output latency over at least one supported audio output device, they are:  *   [C-SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to report low-latency audio by declaring     `android.hardware.audio.low_latency` feature flag. *   [C-SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to meet the requirements for low-latency     audio via the AAudio API. *   [C-SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to ensure that for streams that return     [`AAUDIO_PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY`](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/audio/aaudio/aaudio#performance-mode)     from [`AAudioStream_getPerformanceMode()`](https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/audio#aaudiostream_getperformancemode),     the value returned by [`AAudioStream_getFramesPerBurst()`](https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/audio#aaudiostream_getframesperburst)     is less than or equal to the value returned by [`android.media.AudioManager.getProperty(String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#getProperty%28java.lang.String%29)     for property key [`AudioManager.PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#PROPERTY_OUTPUT_FRAMES_PER_BUFFER).

Existing and new Android devices are **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to meet these requirements that are listed as SHOULD, or they will not be able to attain Android compatibility when upgraded to the future version.  ### 5.4.1\. Raw Audio Capture and Microphone Information  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.microphone`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST allow capture of raw audio content with the following characteristics:       *   **Format**: Linear PCM, 16-bit      *   **Sampling rates**: 8000, 11025, 16000, 44100, 48000 Hz      *   **Channels**: Mono  *   SHOULD allow capture of raw audio content with the following characteristics:      *   **Format**: Linear PCM, 16-bit and 24-bit      *   **Sampling rates**: 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100,      48000 Hz      *   **Channels**: As many channels as the number of microphones on the      device  *   [C-1-2] MUST capture at above sample rates without up-sampling. *   [C-1-3] MUST include an appropriate anti-aliasing filter when the sample rates given above are captured with down-sampling. *   SHOULD allow AM radio and DVD quality capture of raw audio content, which means the following characteristics:       *   **Format**: Linear PCM, 16-bit      *   **Sampling rates**: 22050, 48000 Hz      *   **Channels**: Stereo *   [C-1-4] MUST honor the [`MicrophoneInfo`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MicrophoneInfo) API     and properly fill in information for the available microphones on device     accessible to the third-party applications via the     [`AudioManager.getMicrophones()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#getMicrophones%28%29)     API, and the currently active microphones which are accessible to the third     party applications via the [`AudioRecord.getActiveMicrophones()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord#getActiveMicrophones%28%29)     and [`MediaRecorder.getActiveMicrophones()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder#getActiveMicrophones%28%29)     APIs.

Capture for Voice Recognition  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.microphone`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST capture     `android.media.MediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_RECOGNITION` audio source at     one of the sampling rates, 44100 and 48000. *   [C-1-2] MUST, by default, disable any noise reduction audio processing when     recording an audio stream from the `AudioSource.VOICE_RECOGNITION` audio     source. *   [C-1-3] MUST, by default, disable any automatic gain control when recording     an audio stream from the `AudioSource.VOICE_RECOGNITION` audio source. *   SHOULD record the voice recognition audio stream with approximately flat     amplitude versus frequency characteristics: specifically, ±3 dB, from 100 Hz     to 4000 Hz. *   SHOULD record the voice recognition audio stream with input sensitivity set     such that a 90 dB sound power level (SPL) source at 1000 Hz yields RMS of     2500 for 16-bit samples. *   SHOULD record the voice recognition audio stream so that the PCM amplitude     levels linearly track input SPL changes over at least a 30 dB range from -18     dB to +12 dB re 90 dB SPL at the microphone. *   SHOULD record the voice recognition audio stream with total harmonic     distortion (THD) less than 1% for 1 kHz at 90 dB SPL input level at the     microphone.  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.microphone` and noise suppression (reduction) technologies tuned for speech recognition, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST allow this audio effect to be controllable with the     `android.media.audiofx.NoiseSuppressor` API. *   [C-2-2] MUST uniquely identify each noise suppression technology     implementation via the `AudioEffect.Descriptor.uuid` field.  ### 5.4.3\. Capture for Rerouting of Playback  The `android.media.MediaRecorder.AudioSource` class includes the `REMOTE_SUBMIX` audio source.  If device implementations declare both `android.hardware.audio.output` and `android.hardware.microphone`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST properly implement the `REMOTE_SUBMIX` audio source so that when an application uses the `android.media.AudioRecord` API to record from this audio source, it captures a mix of all audio streams except for the following:      * `AudioManager.STREAM_RING`     * `AudioManager.STREAM_ALARM`     * `AudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATION`  ### 5.4.4\. Acoustic Echo Canceler  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.microphone`, they:  *   SHOULD implement an [Acoustic Echo Canceler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_suppression_and_cancellation) (AEC) technology tuned for voice communication and applied to the capture path when capturing using `AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION`  If device implementations provides an Acoustic Echo Canceler which is inserted in the capture audio path when `AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION` is selected, they:  *   [C-SR] are STRONGLY_RECOMMENDED to declare this via [AcousticEchoCanceler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AcousticEchoCanceler) API method [AcousticEchoCanceler.isAvailable()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AcousticEchoCanceler.html#isAvailable()) *   [C-SR] are STRONGLY_RECOMMENDED to allow this audio effect to be controllable with the [AcousticEchoCanceler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AcousticEchoCanceler) API. *   [C-SR] are STRONGLY_RECOMMENDED to uniquely identify each AEC technology implementation via the [AudioEffect.Descriptor.uuid](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AudioEffect.Descriptor.html#uuid) field.  ### 5.4.5\. Concurrent Capture  If device implementations declare `android.hardware.microphone`,they MUST implement concurrent capture as described in [this document]( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/sharing-audio-input). Specifically:  *   [C-1-1] MUST allow concurrent access to microphone by an accessibility     service capturing with `AudioSource.VOICE_RECOGNITION` and at least one     application capturing with any `AudioSource`. *   [C-1-2] MUST allow concurrent access to microphone by a pre-installed     application that holds an Assistant role and at least one application     capturing with any `AudioSource` except for     `AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION` or `AudioSource.CAMCORDER`. *   [C-1-3] MUST silence the audio capture for any other application, except for     an accessibility service, while an application is capturing with     `AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION` or `AudioSource.CAMCORDER`. However, when     an app is capturing via `AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION` then another app     can capture the voice call if it is a privileged (pre-installed) app with     permission `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT`. *   [C-1-4] If two or more applications are capturing concurrently and if     neither app has an UI on top, the one that started capture the most recently     receives audio.  ### 5.4.6\.

"1_0_intro"	"1.0"	""	"01000000.48"	"1.0"	"""# 1\. Introduction  This document enumerates the requirements that must be met in order for devices to be compatible with Android ANDROID_VERSION.  The use of “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” is per the IETF standard defined in [RFC2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).  As used in this document, a “device implementer” or “implementer” is a person or organization developing a hardware/software solution running Android ANDROID_VERSION. A “device implementation” or “implementation"" is the hardware/software solution so developed.  To be considered compatible with Android ANDROID_VERSION, device implementations MUST meet the requirements presented in this Compatibility Definition, including any documents incorporated via reference.  Where this definition or the software tests described in [section 10](#10_software_compatibility_testing) is silent, ambiguous, or incomplete, it is the responsibility of the device implementer to ensure compatibility with existing implementations.  For this reason, the [Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/) is both the reference and preferred implementation of Android. Device implementers are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to base their implementations to the greatest extent possible on the “upstream” source code available from the Android Open Source Project. While some components can hypothetically be replaced with alternate implementations, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not follow this practice, as passing the software tests will become substantially more difficult. It is the implementer’s responsibility to ensure full behavioral compatibility with the standard Android implementation, including and beyond the Compatibility Test Suite. Finally, note that certain component substitutions and modifications are explicitly forbidden by this document.  Many of the resources linked to in this document are derived directly or indirectly from the Android SDK and will be functionally identical to the information in that SDK’s documentation. In any cases where this Compatibility Definition or the Compatibility Test Suite disagrees with the SDK documentation, the SDK documentation is considered authoritative. Any technical details provided in the linked resources throughout this document are considered by inclusion to be part of this Compatibility Definition. """	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""

Cameras  If device implementations include at least one camera, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST declare the `android.hardware.camera.any` feature flag. *   [C-1-2] MUST be possible for an application to simultaneously allocate 3 RGBA_8888 bitmaps equal to the size of the images produced by the largest-resolution camera sensor on the device, while camera is open for the purpose of basic preview and still capture. *   [C-1-3] MUST ensure that the preinstalled default camera application handling intents [`MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE), [`MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE_SECURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE_SECURE), or [`MediaStore.ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE), is responsible for removing the user location in the image metadata before sending it to the receiving application when the receiving application does not have [`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION).  ### 7.5.1\. Rear-Facing Camera  A rear-facing camera is a camera located on the side of the device opposite the display; that is, it images scenes on the far side of the device, like a traditional camera.  Device implementations:  *   SHOULD include a rear-facing camera.  If device implementations include at least one rear-facing camera, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST report the feature flag `android.hardware.camera` and `android.hardware.camera.any`. *   [C-1-2] MUST have a resolution of at least 2 megapixels. *   SHOULD have either hardware auto-focus or software auto-focus implemented in the camera driver (transparent to application software). *   MAY have fixed-focus or EDOF (extended depth of field) hardware. *   MAY include a flash.  If the camera includes a flash:  *    [C-2-1] the flash lamp MUST NOT be lit while an `android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback` instance has been registered on a Camera preview surface, unless the application has explicitly enabled the flash by enabling the `FLASH_MODE_AUTO` or `FLASH_MODE_ON` attributes of a `Camera.Parameters` object. Note that this constraint does not apply to the device’s built-in system camera application, but only to third-party applications using `Camera.PreviewCallback`.  ### 7.5.2\. Front-Facing Camera  A front-facing camera is a camera located on the same side of the device as the display; that is, a camera typically used to image the user, such as for video conferencing and similar applications.  Device implementations:  *   MAY include a front-facing camera.  If device implementations include at least one front-facing camera, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST report the feature flag `android.hardware.camera.any` and `android.hardware.camera.front`. *   [C-1-2] MUST have a resolution of at least VGA (640x480 pixels). *   [C-1-3] MUST NOT use a front-facing camera as the default for the Camera API and MUST NOT configure the API to treat a front-facing camera as the default rear-facing camera, even if it is the only camera on the device. *   [C-1-4] The camera preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the orientation specified by the application when the current application has explicitly requested that the Camera display be rotated via a call to the [`android.hardware.Camera.setDisplayOrientation()`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#setDisplayOrientation(int)) method. Conversely, the preview MUST be mirrored along the device’s default horizontal axis when the current application does not explicitly request that the Camera display be rotated via a call to the [`android.hardware.Camera.setDisplayOrientation()`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#setDisplayOrientation(int)) method. *   [C-1-5] MUST NOT mirror the final captured still image or video streams returned to application callbacks or committed to media storage. *   [C-1-6] MUST mirror the image displayed by the postview in the same manner as the camera preview image stream. *   MAY include features (such as auto-focus, flash, etc.) available to rear-facing cameras as described in [section 7.5.1](#7_5_1_rear-facing_camera).  If device implementations are capable of being rotated by user (such as automatically via an accelerometer or manually via user input):  *    [C-2-1] The camera preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the device’s current orientation.  ### 7.5.3\. External Camera  Device implementations:  *    MAY include support for an external camera that is not necessarily always connected.  If device implementations include support for an external camera, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST declare the platform feature flag `android.hardware.camera.external` and `android.hardware camera.any`. *   [C-1-2] MUST support USB Video Class (UVC 1.0 or higher) if the external camera connects through the USB host port. *   [C-1-3] MUST pass camera CTS tests with a physical external camera device connected. Details of camera CTS testing are available at [source.android.com]( https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/camera-hal). *   SHOULD support video compressions such as MJPEG to enable transfer of     high-quality unencoded streams (i.e. raw or independently compressed picture     streams). *   MAY support multiple cameras. *   MAY support camera-based video encoding.  If camera-based video encoding is supported:  *    [C-2-1] A simultaneous     unencoded / MJPEG stream (QVGA or greater resolution) MUST be accessible to     the device implementation.  ### 7.5.4\. Camera API Behavior  Android includes two API packages to access the camera, the newer android.hardware.camera2 API expose lower-level camera control to the app, including efficient zero-copy burst/streaming flows and per-frame controls of exposure, gain, white balance gains, color conversion, denoising, sharpening, and more.  The older API package,`android.hardware.Camera`, is marked as deprecated in Android 5.0 but as it should still be available for apps to use. Android device implementations MUST ensure the continued support of the API as described in this section and in the Android SDK.  All features that are common between the deprecated android.hardware.Camera class and the newer android.hardware.camera2 package MUST have equivalent performance and quality in both APIs. For example, with equivalent settings, autofocus speed and accuracy must be identical, and the quality of captured images must be the same. Features that depend on the different semantics of the two APIs are not required to have matching speed or quality, but SHOULD match as closely as possible.  Device implementations MUST implement the following behaviors for the camera-related APIs, for all available cameras. Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST use `android.hardware.PixelFormat.YCbCr_420_SP` for preview data provided to application callbacks when an application has never called `android.hardware.Camera.Parameters.setPreviewFormat(int)`. *   [C-0-2] MUST further be in the NV21 encoding format when an application registers an `android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback` instance and the system calls the `onPreviewFrame()` method and the preview format is YCbCr_420_SP, the data in the byte[] passed into `onPreviewFrame()`. That is, NV21 MUST be the default. *   [C-0-3] MUST support the YV12 format (as denoted by the `android.graphics.ImageFormat.YV12` constant) for camera previews for both front- and rear-facing cameras for `android.hardware.Camera`. (The hardware video encoder and camera may use any native pixel format, but the device implementation MUST support conversion to YV12.) *   [C-0-4] MUST support the `android.hardware.ImageFormat.YUV_420_888` and `android.hardware.ImageFormat.JPEG` formats as outputs through the `android.media.ImageReader` API for `android.hardware.camera2` devices that advertise [`REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE)  capability in [`android.request.availableCapabilities`](  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.html#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES). *   [C-0-5] MUST still implement the full [Camera API]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html) included in the Android SDK documentation, regardless of whether the device includes hardware autofocus or other capabilities. For instance, cameras that lack autofocus MUST still call any registered `android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback` instances (even though this has no relevance to a non-autofocus camera.) Note that this does apply to front-facing cameras; for instance, even though most front-facing cameras do not support autofocus, the API callbacks must still be “faked” as described. *   [C-0-6] MUST recognize and honor each parameter name defined as a constant in the [`android.hardware.Camera.Parameters`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html) class and the [`android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CaptureRequest) class. Conversely, device implementations MUST NOT honor or recognize string constants passed to the `android.hardware.Camera.setParameters()` method other than those documented as constants on the `android.hardware.Camera.Parameters`. That is, device implementations MUST support all standard Camera parameters if the hardware allows, and MUST NOT support custom Camera parameter types. For instance, device implementations that support image capture using high dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques MUST support camera parameter `Camera.SCENE_MODE_HDR`. *   [C-0-7] MUST report the proper level of support with the [`android.info.supportedHardwareLevel`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.html#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL) property as described in the Android SDK and report the appropriate [framework feature flags]( http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html). *   [C-0-8] MUST also declare its individual camera capabilities of `android.hardware.camera2` via the `android.request.availableCapabilities` property and declare the appropriate [feature flags]( http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html); MUST define the feature flag if any of its attached camera devices supports the feature. *   [C-0-9] MUST broadcast the `Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE` intent whenever a new picture is taken by the camera and the entry of the picture has been added to the media store. *   [C-0-10] MUST broadcast the `Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO` intent whenever a new video is recorded by the camera and the entry of the picture has been added to the media store. *   [C-0-11] MUST have all cameras accessible via the deprecated [`android.hardware.Camera`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera) API also accessible via the [`android.hardware.camera2`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) API. *   [C-0-12] MUST ensure that the facial appearance is NOT altered, including     but not limited to altering facial geometry, facial skin tone, or facial     skin smoothening for any [`android.hardware.camera2`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)     or [`android.hardware.Camera`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera)     API. *   [C-SR] For devices with multiple RGB cameras facing in the same direction, are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support a logical camera device that lists capability [`CameraMetadata.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA), consisting of all of the RGB cameras facing that direction as physical sub-devices.  If device implementations provide a proprietary camera API to 3rd-party apps, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST implement such a camera API using [`android.hardware.camera2`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) API. *   MAY provide vendor tags and/or extensions to [`android.hardware.camera2`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) API.  ### 7.5.5\. Camera Orientation  If device implementations have a front- or a rear-facing camera, such camera(s):  *   [C-1-1] MUST be oriented so that the long dimension of the camera aligns with the screen’s long dimension. That is, when the device is held in the landscape orientation, cameras MUST capture images in the landscape orientation. This applies regardless of the device’s natural orientation; that is, it applies to landscape-primary devices as well as portrait-primary devices. """	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""

Biometric Sensors   For additional background on Measuring Biometric Unlock Security, please see [Measuring Biometric Security documentation](https://source.android.com/security/biometric/measure).  If device implementations include a secure lock screen, they:  *   SHOULD include a biometric sensor  Biometric sensors can be classified as **Class 3** (formerly **Strong**), **Class 2** (formerly **Weak**), or **Class 1** (formerly **Convenience**) based on their spoof and imposter acceptance rates, and on the security of the biometric pipeline. This classification determines the capabilities the biometric sensor has to interface with the platform and with third-party applications. Sensors are classified as **Class 1** by default, and need to meet additional requirements as detailed below if they wish to be classified as either **Class 2** or **Class 3**. Both **Class 2** and **Class 3** biometrics get additional capabilities as detailed below.  If device implementations make a biometric sensor available to third-party applications via [android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager), [android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt), and [android.provider.Settings.ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings#ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLL), they:  *   [C-4-1] MUST meet the requirements for **Class 3** or **Class 2** biometric     as defined in this document. *   [C-4-2] MUST recognize and honor each parameter name defined as a constant     in the [Authenticators](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators)     class and any combinations thereof.     Conversely, MUST NOT honor or recognize integer constants passed to the     [canAuthenticate(int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager#canAuthenticate%28int%29)     and [setAllowedAuthenticators(int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.Builder#setAllowedAuthenticators%28int%29)     methods other than those documented as public constants in     [Authenticators](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators)     and any combinations thereof. *   [C-4-3] MUST implement the [ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings#ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLL)     action on devices that have either **Class 3** or **Class 2** biometrics.     This action MUST only present the enrollment entry points for **Class 3**     or **Class 2** biometrics.  If device implementations support passive biometrics, they:  *   [C-5-1] MUST by default require an additional confirmation step     (e.g. a button press). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have a setting to allow users to     override application preference and always require accompanying     confirmation step. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have the confirm action be secured     such that an operating system or kernel compromise cannot spoof it.     For example, this means that the confirm action based on a physical button     is routed through an input-only general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pin of     a secure element (SE) that cannot be driven by any other means than a     physical button press. *   [C-5-2] MUST additionally implement an implicit authentication flow     (without confirmation step) corresponding to     [setConfirmationRequired(boolean)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.Builder#setConfirmationRequired%28boolean%29),     which applications can set to utilize for sign-in flows.  If device implementations have multiple biometric sensors, they:  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to require only one biometric be confirmed     per authentication (e.g. if both fingerprint and face sensors are available     on the device, [onAuthenticationSucceeded](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback.html#onAuthenticationSucceeded%28android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult%29)     should be sent after any one of them is confirmed).  In order for device implementations to allow access to keystore keys to third-party applications, they:  *   [C-6-1] MUST meet the requirements for **Class 3** as defined in this     section below. *   [C-6-2] MUST present only **Class 3** biometrics when the authentication     requires [BIOMETRIC_STRONG](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators#BIOMETRIC_STRONG),     or the authentication is invoked with a     [CryptoObject](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject).

If device implementations wish to treat a biometric sensor as **Class 2** (formerly **Weak**), they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST meet all requirements for **Class 1** above. *   [C-2-2] MUST have a spoof and imposter acceptance rate not higher than 20%     as measured by the [Android Biometrics Test Protocols](https://source.android.com/security/biometric/measure). *   [C-2-3] MUST perform the     biometric matching in an isolated execution environment outside Android     user or kernel space, such as the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), or     on a chip with a secure channel to the isolated execution environment. *   [C-2-4] MUST have all identifiable data encrypted and cryptographically     authenticated such that they cannot be acquired, read or altered outside of     the isolated execution environment or a chip with a secure channel to the     isolated execution environment as documented in the [implementation     guidelines](https://source.android.com/security/biometric#hal-implementation)     on the Android Open Source Project site. *   [C-2-5] For camera based biometrics, while biometric based authentication     or enrollment is happening:     *    MUST operate the camera in a mode that prevents camera frames from     being read or altered outside the isolated execution environment or a chip     with a secure channel to the isolated execution environment.     *    For RGB single-camera solutions, the camera frames CAN be     readable outside the isolated execution environment to support operations     such as preview for enrollment, but MUST still NOT be alterable. *   [C-2-6] MUST NOT enable third-party applications to distinguish between     individual biometric enrollments. *   [C-2-7] MUST NOT allow unencrypted access to identifiable     biometric data or any data derived from it (such as embeddings) to     the Application Processor outside the context of the TEE. *   [C-2-8] MUST have a secure processing pipeline such that an operating     system or kernel compromise cannot allow data to be directly injected to     falsely authenticate as the user.      If device implementations are already launched on an earlier Android     version and cannot meet the requirement C-2-8 through a system software     update, they MAY be exempted from the requirement.  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to include liveness detection for all     biometric modalities and attention detection for Face biometrics.  If device implementations wish to treat a biometric sensor as **Class 3** (formerly **Strong**), they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST meet all the requirements of **Class 2** above, except for     [C-1-7] and [C-1-8]. Upgrading devices from an earlier Android version     are not exempted from C-2-7. *   [C-3-2] MUST have a hardware-backed keystore implementation. *   [C-3-3] MUST have a spoof and imposter acceptance rate not higher than 7%     as measured by the [Android Biometrics Test Protocols](https://source.android.com/security/biometric/measure). *   [C-3-4] MUST challenge the user for the recommended primary     authentication (e.g. PIN, pattern, password) once every 72 hours     or less.  ### 7.3.12\.

Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST report the correct value for     [android.content.res.Configuration.navigation](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#navigation).  If device implementations lack non-touch navigations, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST provide a reasonable alternative user interface mechanism for the     selection and editing of text, compatible with Input Management Engines. The     upstream Android open source implementation includes a selection mechanism     suitable for use with devices that lack non-touch navigation inputs.   ### 7.2.3\. Navigation Keys  The [Home](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#`KEYCODE_HOME`), [Recents](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#`KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH`), and [Back](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#`KEYCODE_BACK`) functions typically provided via an interaction with a dedicated physical button or a distinct portion of the touch screen, are essential to the Android navigation paradigm and therefore, device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST provide a user affordance to launch installed applications     that have an activity with the `<intent-filter>` set with `ACTION=MAIN` and     `CATEGORY=LAUNCHER` or `CATEGORY=LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` for Television device     implementations.     The Home function SHOULD be the mechanism for this user affordance. *   SHOULD provide buttons for the Recents and Back function.  If the Home, Recents, or Back functions are provided, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST be accessible with a single action (e.g. tap, double-click or gesture) when any of them are accessible. *   [C-1-2] MUST provide a clear indication of which single action would trigger each function. Having a visible icon imprinted on the button, showing a software icon on the navigation bar portion of the screen, or walking the user through a guided step-by-step demo flow during the out-of-box setup experience are examples of such an indication.  Device implementations:  *    [SR] are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not provide the input mechanism for the [Menu function](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#`KEYCODE_BACK`) as it is deprecated in favor of action bar since Android 4.0.

If device implementations do not provide the Menu function, for backwards compatibility, they: *    [C-3-1] MUST make the Menu function available to applications when `targetSdkVersion` is less than 10, either by a physical button, a software key, or gestures. This Menu function should be accessible unless hidden together with other navigation functions.  If device implementations provide the [Assist function](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#`KEYCODE_ASSIST`), they:  *    [C-4-1] MUST make the Assist function accessible with a single action (e.g. tap, double-click or gesture) when other navigation keys are accessible. *    [SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use long press on HOME function as this designated interaction.  If device implementations use a distinct portion of the screen to display the navigation keys, they:  *   [C-5-1] Navigation keys MUST use a distinct portion of the screen, not     available to applications, and MUST NOT obscure or otherwise interfere with     the portion of the screen available to applications. *   [C-5-2] MUST make available a portion of the display to applications that     meets the requirements defined in [section 7.1.1](#7_1_1_screen_configuration). *   [C-5-3] MUST honor the flags set by the app through the [`View.setSystemUiVisibility()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setSystemUiVisibility%28int%29)     API method, so that this distinct portion of the screen     (a.k.a. the navigation bar) is properly hidden away as documented in     the SDK.

If a navigation function is provided from anywhere on the left and right edges of the current orientation of the screen:  *   [C-7-1] The navigation function MUST be Back and provided as a swipe from     both left and right edges of the current orientation of the screen. *   [C-7-2] If custom swipeable system panels are provided on the left or     right edges, they MUST be placed within the top 1/3rd of the screen with     a clear, persistent visual indication that dragging in would invoke the     aforementioned panels, and hence not Back. A system panel MAY be     configured by a user such that it lands below the top 1/3rd of the screen     edge(s) but the system panel MUST NOT use longer than 1/3rd of the edge(s). *   [C-7-3] When the foreground app has either the     [`View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE)     or     [`View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY)     flags set, swiping from the edges MUST behave as implemented in AOSP,     which is documented in     [the SDK](https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/immersive). *   [C-7-4] When the foreground app has either the     [`View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE)     or     [`View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY)     flags set, custom swipeable system panels MUST be hidden until the     user brings in the system bars (a.k.a. navigation and status bar) as     implemented in AOSP.  ### 7.2.4\. Touchscreen Input  Android includes support for a variety of pointer input systems, such as touchscreens, touch pads, and fake touch input devices. [Touchscreen-based device implementations](https://source.android.com/devices/input/touch-devices) are associated with a display such that the user has the impression of directly manipulating items on screen. Since the user is directly touching the screen, the system does not require any additional affordances to indicate the objects being manipulated.  Device implementations:  *    SHOULD have a pointer input system of some kind      (either mouse-like or touch). *    SHOULD support fully independently tracked pointers.  If device implementations include a touchscreen (single-touch or better) on a primary Android-compatible display, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST report `TOUCHSCREEN_FINGER` for the [`Configuration.touchscreen`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#touchscreen)      API field. *    [C-1-2] MUST report the `android.hardware.touchscreen` and      `android.hardware.faketouch` feature flags.  If device implementations include a touchscreen that can track more than a single touch on a primary Android-compatible display, they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST report the appropriate feature flags `android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch`, `android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch.distinct`, `android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch.jazzhand` corresponding to the type of the specific touchscreen on the device.  If device implementations rely on an external input device such as mouse or trackball (i.e. not directly touching the screen) for input on a primary Android-compatible display and meet the fake touch requirements in [section 7.2.5](#7_2_5_fake_touch_input), they:  *    [C-3-1] MUST NOT report any feature flag starting with `android.hardware.touchscreen`. *    [C-3-2] MUST report only `android.hardware.faketouch`. *    [C-3-3] MUST report `TOUCHSCREEN_NOTOUCH` for the [`Configuration.touchscreen`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#touchscreen) API field.  ### 7.2.5\. Fake Touch Input  Fake touch interface provides a user input system that approximates a subset of touchscreen capabilities. For example, a  mouse or remote control that drives an on-screen cursor approximates touch, but requires the user to first point or focus then click. Numerous input devices like the mouse, trackpad, gyro-based air mouse, gyro-pointer, joystick, and multi-touch trackpad can support fake touch interactions. Android includes the feature constant android.hardware.faketouch, which corresponds to a high-fidelity non-touch (pointer-based) input device such as a mouse or trackpad that can adequately emulate touch-based input (including basic gesture support), and indicates that the device supports an emulated subset of touchscreen functionality.  If device implementations do not include a touchscreen but include another pointer input system which they want to make available, they:  *    SHOULD declare support for the `android.hardware.faketouch` feature flag.  If device implementations declare support for `android.hardware.faketouch`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST report the [absolute X and Y screen positions]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html) of the pointer location and display a visual pointer on the screen. *   [C-1-2] MUST report touch event with the action code that specifies the state change that occurs on the pointer [going down or up on the screen](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html). *   [C-1-3] MUST support pointer down and up on an object on the screen, which allows users to emulate tap on an object on the screen. *   [C-1-4] MUST support pointer down, pointer up, pointer down then pointer up in the same place on an object on the screen within a time threshold, which allows users to [emulate double tap]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html) on an object on the screen. *   [C-1-5] MUST support pointer down on an arbitrary point on the screen, pointer move to any other arbitrary point on the screen, followed by a pointer up, which allows users to emulate a touch drag. *   [C-1-6] MUST support pointer down then allow users to quickly move the object to a different position on the screen and then pointer up on the screen, which allows users to fling an object on the screen.  If device implementations declare support for `android.hardware.faketouch.multitouch.distinct`, they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST declare support for `android.hardware.faketouch`. *    [C-2-2] MUST support distinct tracking of two or more independent pointer inputs.  If device implementations declare support for `android.hardware.faketouch.multitouch.jazzhand`, they:  *    [C-3-1] MUST declare support for `android.hardware.faketouch`. *    [C-3-2] MUST support distinct tracking of 5 (tracking a hand of fingers) or more pointer inputs fully independently.  ### 7.2.6\. Game Controller Support  #### 7.2.6.1\. Button Mappings  Device implementations:  *    [C-1-1] MUST be capable to map HID events to the corresponding [`InputEvent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/InputEvent) constants as listed in the below tables.

"7_1_display-and-graphics"	"7.1"	""	"07010000.48"	"7.1"	"""## 7.1\. Display and Graphics  Android includes facilities that automatically adjust application assets and UI layouts appropriately for the device to ensure that third-party applications run well on a [variety of hardware configurations]( http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html). On the Android-compatible display(s) where all third-party Android-compatible applications can run, device implementations MUST properly implement these APIs and behaviors, as detailed in this section.  The units referenced by the requirements in this section are defined as follows:  *   **physical diagonal size**. The distance in inches between two opposing corners of the illuminated portion of the display. *   **dots per inch (dpi)**. The number of pixels encompassed by a linear horizontal or vertical span of 1”. Where dpi values are listed, both horizontal and vertical dpi must fall within the range. *   **aspect ratio**. The ratio of the pixels of the longer dimension to the shorter dimension of the screen. For example, a display of 480x854 pixels would be 854/480 = 1.779, or roughly “16:9”. *   **density-independent pixel (dp)**. The virtual pixel unit normalized to a 160 dpi screen, calculated as: pixels = dps * (density/160).  ### 7.1.1\. Screen Configuration  #### 7.1.1.1\. Screen Size and Shape  The Android UI framework supports a variety of different logical screen layout sizes, and allows applications to query the current configuration's screen layout size via `Configuration.screenLayout` with the `SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK` and `Configuration.smallestScreenWidthDp`.  Device implementations:  *    [C-0-1] MUST report the correct layout size for the  `Configuration.screenLayout` as defined in the Android SDK documentation.  Specifically, device implementations MUST report the correct logical  density-independent pixel (dp) screen dimensions as below:       *   Devices with the `Configuration.uiMode` set as any value other than      UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH, and reporting a `small` size for the      `Configuration.screenLayout`, MUST have at least 426 dp x 320 dp.      *   Devices reporting a `normal` size for the `Configuration.screenLayout`,      MUST have at least 480 dp x 320 dp.      *   Devices reporting a `large` size for the `Configuration.screenLayout`,      MUST have at least 640 dp x 480 dp.      *   Devices reporting a `xlarge` size for the `Configuration.screenLayout`,      MUST have at least 960 dp x 720 dp.  *   [C-0-2] MUST correctly honor applications' stated  support for screen sizes through the [&lt;`supports-screens`&gt;](  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html)  attribute in the AndroidManifest.xml, as described  in the Android SDK documentation.  *    MAY have the Android-compatible display(s) with rounded corners.  If device implementations support `UI_MODE_TYPE_NORMAL` and include Android-compatible display(s) with rounded corners, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST ensure that at least one of the following requirements  is met:   *  The radius of the rounded corners is less than or equal to 38 dp.   *  When a 15 dp by 15 dp box is anchored at each corner of the logical      display, at least one pixel of each box is visible on the screen.  *    SHOULD include user affordance to switch to the display mode with the rectangular corners.  If device implementations include an Android-compatible display(s) that is foldable, or includes a folding hinge between multiple display panels and makes such display(s) available to render third-party apps, they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST implement the latest available stable version of the [extensions API]( https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window-extensions) or the stable version of [sidecar API]( https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:window/window-sidecar/api/) to be used by [Window Manager Jetpack]( https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) library.  If device implementations include an Android-compatible display(s) that is foldable, or includes a folding hinge between multiple display panels and if the hinge or fold crosses a fullscreen application window, they:  *    [C-3-1] MUST report the position, bounds and state of hinge or fold through      extensions or sidecar APIs to the application.  For details on correctly implementing the sidecar or extension APIs refer to the public documentation of [Window Manager Jetpack]( https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window).  #### 7.1.1.2\. Screen Aspect Ratio  While there is no restriction to the aspect ratio of the physical display for the Android-compatible display(s), the aspect ratio of the logical display where third-party apps are rendered, which can be derived from the height and width values reported through the [`view.Display`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html) APIs and [Configuration]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html) APIs, MUST meet the following requirements:  *   [C-0-1] Device implementations with `Configuration.uiMode` set to     `UI_MODE_TYPE_NORMAL` MUST have an aspect ratio value less than or equal     to 1.86 (roughly 16:9), unless the app meets one of the following     conditions:       *  The app has declared that it supports a larger screen aspect ratio      through  the [`android.max_aspect`](      https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens-distribution)      metadata value.      *  The app declares it is resizeable via the [android:resizeableActivity](      https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html#configuring)      attribute.      *  The app targets API level 24 or higher and does not declare an      [`android:maxAspectRatio`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#maxAspectRatio)      that would restrict the allowed aspect ratio.  *   [C-0-2] Device implementations with `Configuration.uiMode` set to     `UI_MODE_TYPE_NORMAL` MUST have an aspect ratio value equal to or greater     than 1.3333 (4:3), unless the app can be stretched wider by meeting one of     the following conditions:       *  The app declares it is resizeable via the [android:resizeableActivity](      https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html#configuring)      attribute.      *  The app declares an [`android:minAspectRatio`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#minAspectRatio)      that would restrict the allowed aspect ratio.  *   [C-0-3] Device implementations with the `Configuration.uiMode` set as     `UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH` MUST have an aspect ratio value set as 1.0 (1:1).  #### 7.1.1.3\. Screen Density  The Android UI framework defines a set of standard logical densities to help application developers target application resources.  *    [C-0-1] By default, device implementations MUST report only one of the following logical Android framework densities through the [DENSITY_DEVICE_STABLE]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html#DENSITY_DEVICE_STABLE) API and this value MUST NOT change at any time; however, the device MAY report a different arbitrary density according to the display configuration changes made by the user (for example, display size) set after initial boot.      *   120 dpi (ldpi)     *   140 dpi (140dpi)     *   160 dpi (mdpi)     *   180 dpi (180dpi)     *   200 dpi (200dpi)     *   213 dpi (tvdpi)     *   220 dpi (220dpi)     *   240 dpi (hdpi)     *   260 dpi (260dpi)     *   280 dpi (280dpi)     *   300 dpi (300dpi)     *   320 dpi (xhdpi)     *   340 dpi (340dpi)     *   360 dpi (360dpi)     *   400 dpi (400dpi)     *   420 dpi (420dpi)     *   480 dpi (xxhdpi)     *   560 dpi (560dpi)     *   640 dpi (xxxhdpi)  *    Device implementations SHOULD define the standard Android framework density      that is numerically closest to the physical density of the screen, unless that      logical density pushes the reported screen size below the minimum supported. If      the standard Android framework density that is numerically closest to the      physical density results in a screen size that is smaller than the smallest      supported compatible screen size (320 dp width), device implementations SHOULD      report the next lowest standard Android framework density.   If there is an affordance to change the display size of the device:  *  [C-1-1] The display size MUST NOT be scaled any larger than 1.5 times the native density or    produce an effective minimum screen dimension smaller than 320dp (equivalent    to resource qualifier sw320dp), whichever comes first. *  [C-1-2] Display size MUST NOT be scaled any smaller than 0.85 times the native density. *  To ensure good usability and consistent font sizes, it is RECOMMENDED that the    following scaling of Native Display options be provided (while complying with the limits    specified above)    *  Small: 0.85x    *  Default: 1x (Native display scale)    *  Large: 1.15x    *  Larger: 1.3x    *  Largest 1.45x  ### 7.1.2\. Display Metrics  If device implementations include the Android-compatible display(s) or video output to the Android-compatible display screen(s), they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST report correct values for all Android-compatible display metrics defined in the  [`android.util.DisplayMetrics`](  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html) API.  If device implementations does not include an embedded screen or video output, they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST report correct values of the Android-compatible display  as defined in the [`android.util.DisplayMetrics`](  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html) API  for the emulated default `view.Display`.   ### 7.1.3\. Screen Orientation  Device implementations:  *    [C-0-1] MUST report which screen orientations they support      (`android.hardware.screen.portrait` and/or      `android.hardware.screen.landscape`) and MUST report at least one supported      orientation. For example, a device with a fixed orientation landscape      screen, such as a television or laptop, SHOULD only      report `android.hardware.screen.landscape`. *    [C-0-2] MUST report the correct value for the device’s current      orientation, whenever queried via the      `android.content.res.Configuration.orientation`,      `android.view.Display.getOrientation()`, or other APIs.  If device implementations support both screen orientations, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST support dynamic orientation by applications to either portrait or landscape screen      orientation. That is, the device must respect the application’s request for a specific screen      orientation. *    [C-1-2] MUST NOT change the reported screen size or density when changing orientation. *    MAY select either portrait or landscape orientation as the default.   ### 7.1.4\. 2D and 3D Graphics Acceleration  #### 7.1.4.1 OpenGL ES  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST correctly identify the supported OpenGL ES versions (1.1, 2.0,     3.0, 3.1, 3.2) through the managed APIs (such as via the     `GLES10.getString()` method) and the native APIs. *   [C-0-2] MUST include the support for all the corresponding managed APIs and     native APIs for every OpenGL ES versions they identified to support.  If device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST support both OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0, as embodied and detailed     in the [Android SDK documentation](     https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support OpenGL ES 3.1. *   SHOULD support OpenGL ES 3.2.  If device implementations support any of the OpenGL ES versions, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST report via the OpenGL ES managed APIs and native APIs any     other OpenGL ES extensions they have implemented, and conversely MUST     NOT report extension strings that they do not support. *   [C-2-2] MUST support the `EGL_KHR_image`, `EGL_KHR_image_base`,     `EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer`, `EGL_ANDROID_get_native_client_buffer`,     `EGL_KHR_wait_sync`, `EGL_KHR_get_all_proc_addresses`,     `EGL_ANDROID_presentation_time`, `EGL_KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage`,     `EGL_ANDROID_recordable`, and `EGL_ANDROID_GLES_layers` extensions. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support the `EGL_KHR_partial_update` and     `OES_EGL_image_external` extensions. *   SHOULD accurately report via the `getString()` method, any texture     compression format that they support, which is typically vendor-specific.  If device implementations declare support for OpenGL ES 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2, they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST export the corresponding function symbols for these version in     addition to the OpenGL ES 2.0 function symbols in the libGLESv2.so library. *   [SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support the `OES_EGL_image_external_essl3`     extension.  If device implementations support OpenGL ES 3.2, they:  *    [C-4-1] MUST support the OpenGL ES Android Extension Pack in its entirety.  If device implementations support the OpenGL ES [Android Extension Pack]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLES31Ext.html) in its entirety, they:  *   [C-5-1] MUST identify the support through the `android.hardware.opengles.aep`     feature flag.  If device implementations expose support for the `EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer` extension, they:  *   [C-6-1] MUST also support the `EGL_ANDROID_front_buffer_auto_refresh`     extension.  #### 7.1.4.2 Vulkan  Android includes support for [Vulkan]( https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-wsi&lowbarextensions/xhtml/vkspec.html) , a low-overhead, cross-platform API for high-performance 3D graphics.  If device implementations support OpenGL ES 3.1, they:  *    [SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to include support for Vulkan 1.1.  If device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *    SHOULD include support for Vulkan 1.1.  The Vulkan dEQP tests are partitioned into a number of test lists, each with an associated date/version.  These are in the Android source tree at `external/deqp/android/cts/master/vk-master-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.  A device that supports Vulkan at a self-reported level indicates that it can pass the dEQP tests in all test lists from this level and earlier.  If device implementations include support for Vulkan 1.0 or higher, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST report the correct integer value with the     `android.hardware.vulkan.level` and `android.hardware.vulkan.version`     feature flags. *   [C-1-2] MUST enumerate, at least one `VkPhysicalDevice` for the Vulkan     native API [`vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices()`](     https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/man/html/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.html)     . *   [C-1-3] MUST fully implement the Vulkan 1.0 APIs for each enumerated     `VkPhysicalDevice`. *   [C-1-4] MUST enumerate layers, contained in native libraries named as     `libVkLayer*.so` in the application package’s native library directory,     through the Vulkan native APIs [`vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties()`](     https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/man/html/vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties.html)     and [`vkEnumerateDeviceLayerProperties()`](     https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/man/html/vkEnumerateDeviceLayerProperties.html)     . *   [C-1-5] MUST NOT enumerate layers provided by libraries outside of the     application package, or provide other ways of tracing or intercepting the     Vulkan API, unless the application has the `android:debuggable` attribute     set as `true`. *   [C-1-6] MUST report all extension strings that they do support via the     Vulkan native APIs , and conversely MUST NOT report extension strings     that they do not correctly support. *   [C-1-7] MUST support the VK_KHR_surface, VK_KHR_android_surface, VK_KHR_swapchain,     and VK_KHR_incremental_present extensions. *   [C-1-8] MUST report the maximum version of the Vulkan dEQP Tests     supported via the `android.software.vulkan.deqp.level` feature flag. *   [C-1-9] MUST at least support version `132317953` (from Mar 1st, 2019) as     reported in the `android.software.vulkan.deqp.level` feature flag. *   [C-1-10] MUST pass all Vulkan dEQP Tests in the test lists between     version `132317953` and the version specified in the     `android.software.vulkan.deqp.level` feature flag. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support the VK_KHR_driver_properties and     VK_GOOGLE_display_timing extensions.  If device implementations do not include support for Vulkan 1.0, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST NOT declare any of the Vulkan feature flags (e.g.     `android.hardware.vulkan.level`, `android.hardware.vulkan.version`). *   [C-2-2] MUST NOT enumerate any `VkPhysicalDevice` for the Vulkan native API     `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices()`.  If device implementations include support for Vulkan 1.1 and declare any of the Vulkan feature flags, they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST expose support for the `SYNC_FD` external semaphore and handle     types and the `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` extension.  #### 7.1.4.3 RenderScript  *    [C-0-1] Device implementations MUST support [Android RenderScript](      http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/), as detailed      in the Android SDK documentation.  #### 7.1.4.4 2D Graphics Acceleration  Android includes a mechanism for applications to declare that they want to enable hardware acceleration for 2D graphics at the Application, Activity, Window, or View level through the use of a manifest tag [android:hardwareAccelerated]( http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html) or direct API calls.  Device implementations:  *    [C-0-1] MUST enable hardware acceleration by default, and MUST      disable hardware acceleration if the developer so requests by setting      android:hardwareAccelerated=""false” or disabling hardware acceleration      directly through the Android View APIs. *    [C-0-2] MUST exhibit behavior consistent with the      Android SDK documentation on [hardware acceleration](      http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html).  Android includes a TextureView object that lets developers directly integrate hardware-accelerated OpenGL ES textures as rendering targets in a UI hierarchy.  Device implementations:  *    [C-0-3] MUST support the TextureView API, and MUST exhibit      consistent behavior with the upstream Android implementation.  #### 7.1.4.5 Wide-gamut Displays  If device implementations claim support for wide-gamut displays through [`Configuration.isScreenWideColorGamut()` ](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#isScreenWideColorGamut%28%29) , they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST have a color-calibrated display. *   [C-1-2] MUST have a display whose gamut covers the sRGB color gamut     entirely in CIE 1931 xyY space. *   [C-1-3] MUST have a display whose gamut has an area of at least 90% of     DCI-P3 in CIE 1931 xyY space. *   [C-1-4] MUST support OpenGL ES 3.1 or 3.2 and report it properly. *   [C-1-5] MUST advertise support for the `EGL_KHR_no_config_context`,     `EGL_EXT_pixel_format_float`, `EGL_KHR_gl_colorspace`,     `EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb`, `EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb_linear`,     `EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3`, `EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3_linear`,     and `EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_display_p3_passthrough`     extensions. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support `GL_EXT_sRGB`.  Conversely, if device implementations do not support wide-gamut displays, they:  *   [C-2-1] SHOULD cover 100% or more of sRGB in CIE 1931 xyY space, although     the screen color gamut is undefined.  ### 7.1.5\. Legacy Application Compatibility Mode  Android specifies a “compatibility mode” in which the framework operates in a 'normal' screen size equivalent (320dp width) mode for the benefit of legacy applications not developed for old versions of Android that pre-date screen-size independence.  ### 7.1.6\. Screen Technology  The Android platform includes APIs that allow applications to render rich graphics to an Android-compatible display. Devices MUST support all of these APIs as defined by the Android SDK unless specifically allowed in this document.  All of a device implementation's Android-compatible displays:  *   [C-0-1] MUST be capable of rendering 16-bit color graphics. *   SHOULD support displays capable of 24-bit color graphics. *   [C-0-2] MUST be capable of rendering animations. *   [C-0-3] MUST have a pixel aspect ratio (PAR)     between 0.9 and 1.15\. That is, the pixel aspect ratio MUST be near square     (1.0) with a 10 ~ 15% tolerance.  ### 7.1.7\. Secondary Displays  Android includes support for secondary Android-compatible displays to enable media sharing capabilities and developer APIs for accessing external displays.  If device implementations support an external display either via a wired, wireless, or an embedded additional display connection, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST implement the [`DisplayManager`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/display/DisplayManager.html)     system service and API as described in the Android SDK documentation.

"11_0_intro"	"11.0"	""	"11000000.48"	"11.0"	"""# 11\. Updatable Software  *    [C-0-1] Device implementations MUST include a mechanism to replace the entirety of the system software. The mechanism need not perform “live” upgrades—that is, a device restart MAY be required. Any method can be used, provided that it can replace the entirety of the software preinstalled on the device. For instance, any of the following approaches will satisfy this requirement:       *   “Over-the-air (OTA)” downloads with offline update via reboot.      *   “Tethered” updates over USB from a host PC.      *   “Offline” updates via a reboot and update from a file on removable storage.  *    [C-0-2] The update mechanism used MUST support updates without wiping user data. That is, the update mechanism MUST preserve application private data and application shared data. Note that the upstream Android software includes an update mechanism that satisfies this requirement.  *    [C-0-3] The entire update MUST be signed and the on-device update mechanism      MUST verify the update and signature against a public key stored on device. *    [C-SR] The signing mechanism is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to hash the update      with SHA-256 and validate the hash against the public key using ECDSA NIST      P-256.  If the device implementations includes support for an unmetered data connection such as 802.11 or Bluetooth PAN (Personal Area Network) profile, then, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST support OTA downloads with offline update via reboot.  For device implementations that are launching with Android 6.0 and later, the update mechanism SHOULD support verifying that the system image is binary identical to expected result following an OTA.

Android device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST preload the AOSP implementation of both the shared library     `ExtShared` and services `ExtServices` with versions greater than or equal to     the minimum versions allowed per each API level. For example, Android 7.0     device implementations, running API level 24 MUST include at least     version 1.  *   [C-0-2] MUST only return valid extension version number that have been     defined by the AOSP.  *   [C-0-3] MUST support all the APIs defined by the extension versions     returned by `android.os.ext.SdkExtensions.getExtensionVersion(int apiLevel)`     in the same manner as other managed APIs are supported, following the     requirements in [section 3.1](#3_1_managed-api-compatibility).  ### 3.1.2\. Android Library  Due to [Apache HTTP client deprecation](https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes#apache-p), device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST NOT place the `org.apache.http.legacy` library in the bootclasspath. *   [C-0-2] MUST add the `org.apache.http.legacy` library to the application classpath only when the app satisfies one of the following conditions:     *    Targets API level 28 or lower.     *    Declares in its manifest that it needs the library by setting the     `android:name` attribute of `<uses-library>` to `org.apache.http.legacy`.  The AOSP implementation meets these requirements. """	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""

If a device implementation lacks     hardware, the corresponding APIs MUST be implemented as no-ops. This behavior is     further detailed in [section 7](#7_hardware_compatibility). *   [C-1-2]  MUST correctly render all [resources](     https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html)     (icons, animation files, etc.) provided for in the APIs, or in the     Status/System Bar [icon style guide](     http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html), although they     MAY provide an alternative user experience for notifications than that     provided by the reference Android Open Source implementation. *   [C-1-3] MUST honor and implement properly the behaviors described for     [the APIs](     https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#Managing)     to update, remove and group notifications. *   [C-1-4] MUST provide the full behavior of the [NotificationChannel](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel.html)     API documented in the SDK. *   [C-1-5] MUST provide a user affordance to block and modify a certain     third-party app's notification per each channel and app package level. *   [C-1-6] MUST also provide a user affordance to display deleted notification     channels. *   [C-1-7] MUST correctly render all resources (images, stickers, icons, etc.)     provided through [Notification.MessagingStyle](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MessagingStyle)     alongside the notification text without additional user interaction. For     example, MUST show all resources including icons provided through     [android.app.Person](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Person)     in a group conversation that is set through [setGroupConversation](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MessagingStyle.html?hl=es-AR#setGroupConversation%28boolean%29). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to automatically surface a user affordance     to block a certain third-party app's notification per each channel and app     package level after the user dismisses that notification multiple times. *   SHOULD support rich notifications. *   SHOULD present some higher priority notifications as heads-up notifications. *   SHOULD have a user affordance to snooze notifications. *   MAY only manage the visibility and timing of when third-party apps can notify     users of notable events to mitigate safety issues such as driver distraction.  Android 11 introduces support for conversation notifications, which are notifications that use [MessagingStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MessagingStyle.html) and provides a published [People](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Person) Shortcut ID.  Device implementations:  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to group and display     [`conversation notifications`](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/conversations#api-notifications)     ahead of non conversation notifications with the exception of     ongoing foreground service notifications and [`importance:high`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager#IMPORTANCE_HIGH)     notifications.  If device implementations support [`conversation notifications`](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/conversations#api-notifications) and the app provides the required data for [`bubbles`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/bubbles), they:  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to display this conversation as a bubble.     The AOSP implementation meets these requirements with the default System UI,     Settings, and Launcher.  If device implementations support rich notifications, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST use the exact resources as     provided through the [`Notification.Style`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Style.html)     API class and its subclasses for the presented resource elements. *   SHOULD present each and every resource element (e.g.     icon, title and summary text) defined in the [`Notification.Style`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Style.html)     API class and its subclasses.  If device implementations support heads-up notifications: they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST use the heads-up notification view and resources     as described in the [`Notification.Builder`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder.html)     API class when heads-up notifications are presented. *   [C-3-2] MUST display the actions provided through     [`Notification.Builder.addAction()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#addAction%28android.app.Notification.Action%29)     together with the notification content without additional user interaction     as described in [the SDK](     https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#Heads-up).  #### 3.8.3.2\. Notification Listener Service  Android includes the [`NotificationListenerService`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html) APIs that allow apps (once explicitly enabled by the user) to receive a copy of all notifications as they are posted or updated.  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST correctly and promptly update notifications in their entirety     to all such installed and user-enabled listener services, including any and     all metadata attached to the Notification object. *   [C-0-2] MUST respect the [`snoozeNotification()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html#snoozeNotification%28java.lang.String, long%29)     API call, and dismiss the notification and make a callback after the snooze     duration that is set in the API call.  If device implementations have a user affordance to snooze notifications, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST reflect the snoozed notification status properly     through the standard APIs such as     [`NotificationListenerService.getSnoozedNotifications()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html#getSnoozedNotifications%28%29). *   [C-1-2] MUST make this user affordance available to snooze notifications     from each installed third-party app's, unless they are from     persistent/foreground services.  #### 3.8.3.3\. DND (Do not Disturb)  If device implementations support the DND feature, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST, for when the device implementation has provided a means for the user     to grant or deny third-party apps to access the DND policy configuration,     display [Automatic DND rules](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager.html#addAutomaticZenRule%28android.app.AutomaticZenRule%29)     created by applications alongside the user-created and pre-defined rules. *   [C-1-3] MUST honor the [`suppressedVisualEffects`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager.Policy.html#suppressedVisualEffects)     values passed along the [`NotificationManager.Policy`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager.Policy.html#NotificationManager.Policy%28int, int, int, int%29)     and if an app has set any of the SUPPRESSED_EFFECT_SCREEN_OFF or     SUPPRESSED_EFFECT_SCREEN_ON flags, it SHOULD indicate to the user that the     visual effects are suppressed in the DND settings menu.  ### 3.8.4\. Search  Android includes APIs that allow developers to [incorporate search](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/SearchManager.html) into their applications and expose their application’s data into the global system search. Generally speaking, this functionality consists of a single, system-wide user interface that allows users to enter queries, displays suggestions as users type, and displays results. The Android APIs allow developers to reuse this interface to provide search within their own apps and allow developers to supply results to the common global search user interface.  *   Android device implementations SHOULD include global search, a single, shared, system-wide search user interface capable of real-time suggestions in response to user input.  If device implementations implement the global search interface, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST implement the APIs that allow third-party applications to add     suggestions to the search box when it is run in global search mode.  If no third-party applications are installed that make use of the global search:  *   The default behavior SHOULD be to display web search engine results and     suggestions.  Android also includes the [Assist APIs]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/assist/package-summary.html) to allow applications to elect how much information of the current context is shared with the assistant on the device.  If device implementations support the Assist action, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST indicate clearly to the end user when the context is shared, by     either:     *   Each time the assist app accesses the context, displaying a white     light around the edges of the screen that meet or exceed the duration and     brightness of the Android Open Source Project implementation.     *   For the preinstalled assist app, providing a user affordance less     than two navigations away from     [the default voice input and assistant app settings menu](#3_2_3_5_default_app_settings),     and only sharing the context when the assist app is explicitly invoked by     the user through a hotword or assist navigation key input. *   [C-2-2] The designated interaction to launch the assist app as described     in [section 7.2.3](#7_2_3_navigation_keys) MUST launch the user-selected     assist app, in other words the app that implements `VoiceInteractionService`,     or an activity handling the `ACTION_ASSIST` intent.  ### 3.8.5\. Alerts and Toasts  Applications can use the [`Toast`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html) API to display short non-modal strings to the end user that disappear after a brief period of time, and use the [`TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY) window type API to display alert windows as an overlay over other apps.  If device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST provide a user affordance to block an app from displaying alert windows that use the [`TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY) . The AOSP implementation meets this requirement by having controls in the notification shade.  *   [C-1-2] MUST honor the Toast API and display Toasts from applications to end users in some highly visible manner.  ### 3.8.6\. Themes  Android provides “themes” as a mechanism for applications to apply styles across an entire Activity or application.  Android includes a “Holo” and ""Material"" theme family as a set of defined styles for application developers to use if they want to match the [Holo theme look and feel](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html) as defined by the Android SDK.  If device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST NOT alter any of the [Holo theme attributes](     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html) exposed to     applications. *   [C-1-2] MUST support the “Material” theme family and MUST NOT alter any of     the [Material theme attributes](     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html#Theme_Material)     or their assets exposed to applications. *   [C-1-3] MUST use the [Roboto version 2.x](https://github.com/google/roboto)     fonts as the out-of-box Sans-serif font family for languages that Roboto     supports.  Android also includes a “Device Default” theme family as a set of defined styles for application developers to use if they want to match the look and feel of the device theme as defined by the device implementer.  *   Device implementations MAY modify the [Device Default theme attributes](     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html) exposed to     applications.  Android supports a variant theme with translucent system bars, which allows application developers to fill the area behind the status and navigation bar with their app content. To enable a consistent developer experience in this configuration, it is important the status bar icon style is maintained across different device implementations.  If device implementations include a system status bar, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST use white for system status icons (such as signal strength and     battery level) and notifications issued by the system, unless the icon is     indicating a problematic status or an app requests a light status bar using     the SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LIGHT_STATUS_BAR flag. *   [C-2-2] Android device implementations MUST change the color of the system     status icons to black (for details, refer to [R.style](     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.style.html)) when an app     requests a light status bar.  ### 3.8.7\. Live Wallpapers  Android defines a component type and corresponding API and lifecycle that allows applications to expose one or more [“Live Wallpapers”](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/wallpaper/WallpaperService.html) to the end user. Live wallpapers are animations, patterns, or similar images with limited input capabilities that display as a wallpaper, behind other applications.  Hardware is considered capable of reliably running live wallpapers if it can run all live wallpapers, with no limitations on functionality, at a reasonable frame rate with no adverse effects on other applications. If limitations in the hardware cause wallpapers and/or applications to crash, malfunction, consume excessive CPU or battery power, or run at unacceptably low frame rates, the hardware is considered incapable of running live wallpaper. As an example, some live wallpapers may use an OpenGL 2.0 or 3.x context to render their content. Live wallpaper will not run reliably on hardware that does not support multiple OpenGL contexts because the live wallpaper use of an OpenGL context may conflict with other applications that also use an OpenGL context.  *   Device implementations capable of running live wallpapers reliably as described above SHOULD implement live wallpapers.  If device implementations implement live wallpapers, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST report the platform feature flag android.software.live_wallpaper.  ### 3.8.8\. Activity Switching  The upstream Android source code includes the [overview screen](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/recents.html), a system-level user interface for task switching and displaying recently accessed activities and tasks using a thumbnail image of the application’s graphical state at the moment the user last left the application.  Device implementations including the recents function navigation key as detailed in [section 7.2.3](#7_2_3_navigation_keys) MAY alter the interface.  If device implementations including the recents function navigation key as detailed in [section 7.2.3](#7_2_3_navigation_keys) alter the interface, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST support at least up to 7 displayed activities. *   SHOULD at least display the title of 4 activities at a time. *   [C-1-2] MUST implement the [screen pinning behavior](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning)     and provide the user with a settings menu to toggle the feature. *   SHOULD display highlight color, icon, screen title in recents. *   SHOULD display a closing affordance (""x"") but MAY delay this until user interacts with screens. *   SHOULD implement a shortcut to switch easily to the previous activity. *   SHOULD trigger the fast-switch action between the two most recently used     apps, when the recents function key is tapped twice. *   SHOULD trigger the split-screen multiwindow-mode, if supported, when the     recents functions key is long pressed. *   MAY display affiliated recents as a group that moves together. *   [SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use the upstream Android user interface (or a similar thumbnail-based interface) for the overview screen.  ### 3.8.9\. Input Management  Android includes support for [Input Management](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/creating-input-method.html) and support for third-party input method editors.  If device implementations allow users to use third-party input methods on the device, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST declare the platform feature android.software.input_methods and     support IME APIs as defined in the Android SDK documentation.   ### 3.8.10\. Lock Screen Media Control  The Remote Control Client API is deprecated from Android 5.0 in favor of the [Media Notification Template](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MediaStyle.html) that allows media applications to integrate with playback controls that are displayed on the lock screen.   ### 3.8.11\. Screen savers (previously Dreams)  See [section 3.2.3.5](#3_2_3_5_conditional_application_intents) for settings intent to congfigure screen savers.  ### 3.8.12\. Location  If device implementations include a hardware sensor (e.g. GPS) that is capable of providing the location coordinates, they  *   [C-1-2] MUST display the [current status of location](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager.html#isLocationEnabled%28%29)     in the Location menu within Settings. *   [C-1-3] MUST NOT display [location modes](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#LOCATION_MODE)     in the Location menu within Settings.  ### 3.8.13\. Unicode and Font  Android includes support for the emoji characters defined in [Unicode 10.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/).  If device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST be capable of rendering these emoji characters in color glyph. *   [C-1-2] MUST include support for:      *   Roboto 2 font with different weights—sans-serif-thin, sans-serif-light,        sans-serif-medium, sans-serif-black, sans-serif-condensed,        sans-serif-condensed-light for the languages available on the device.      *   Full Unicode 7.0 coverage of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, including the        Latin Extended A, B, C, and D ranges, and all glyphs in the currency        symbols block of Unicode 7.0. *   SHOULD support the skin tone and diverse family emojis as specified in the     [Unicode Technical Report #51](http://unicode.org/reports/tr51).   If device implementations include an IME, they:  *   SHOULD provide an input method to the user for these emoji characters.  Android includes support to render Myanmar fonts. Myanmar has several non-Unicode compliant fonts, commonly known as “Zawgyi,” for rendering Myanmar languages.  If device implementations include support for Burmese, they:      * [C-2-1] MUST render text with Unicode compliant font as default;       non-Unicode compliant font MUST NOT be set as default font unless the user       chooses it in the language picker.     * [C-2-2] MUST support a Unicode font and a non-Unicode compliant font if a       non-Unicode compliant font is supported on the device.  Non-Unicode       compliant font MUST NOT remove or overwrite the Unicode font.     * [C-2-3] MUST render text with non-Unicode compliant font ONLY IF a       language code with [script code Qaag](       http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_script_subtag_validity) is       specified (e.g. my-Qaag). No other ISO language or region codes (whether       assigned, unassigned, or reserved) can be used to refer to non-Unicode       compliant font for Myanmar. App developers and web page authors can       specify my-Qaag as the designated language code as they would for any       other language.  ### 3.8.14\. Multi-windows  If device implementations have the capability to display multiple activities at the same time, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST implement such multi-window mode(s) in accordance with the     application behaviors and APIs described in the Android SDK     [multi-window mode support documentation](     https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html) and meet     the following requirements: *   [C-1-2] MUST honor [`android:resizeableActivity`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#resizeableActivity)     that is set by an app in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as described in     [this SDK](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#resizeableActivity). *   [C-1-3] MUST NOT offer split-screen or freeform mode if     the screen height is less than 440 dp and the screen width is less than 440     dp. *   [C-1-4] An activity MUST NOT be resized to a size smaller than 220dp in     multi-window modes other than Picture-in-Picture. *   Device implementations with screen size `xlarge` SHOULD support freeform     mode.  If device implementations support multi-window mode(s), and the split screen mode, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST honor the declared [`AndroidManifestLayout_minWidth`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html#AndroidManifestLayout_minWidth)     and [`AndroidManifestLayout_minHeight`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html#AndroidManifestLayout_minHeight)     values of the third-party launcher application and not override these values     in the course of showing some content of the docked activity.   If device implementations support multi-window mode(s) and Picture-in-Picture multi-window mode, they:  *   [C-3-1] MUST launch activities in picture-in-picture multi-window mode     when the app is:         *   Targeting API level 26 or higher and declares         [`android:supportsPictureInPicture`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#supportsPictureInPicture)         *   Targeting API level 25 or lower and declares both [`android:resizeableActivity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#resizeableActivity)         and [`android:supportsPictureInPicture`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#supportsPictureInPicture). *   [C-3-2] MUST expose the actions in their SystemUI as     specified by the current PIP activity through the [`setActions()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PictureInPictureParams.Builder.html#setActions%28java.util.List<android.app.RemoteAction>%29)     API. *   [C-3-3] MUST support aspect ratios greater than or equal to     1:2.39 and less than or equal to 2.39:1, as specified by the PIP activity through     the [`setAspectRatio()`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PictureInPictureParams.Builder.html#setAspectRatio%28android.util.Rational%29)     API. *   [C-3-4] MUST use [`KeyEvent.KEYCODE_WINDOW`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#KEYCODE_WINDOW)     to control the PIP window; if PIP mode is not implemented, the key MUST be     available to the foreground activity. *   [C-3-5] MUST provide a user affordance to block an app from displaying in     PIP mode; the AOSP implementation meets this requirement by having     controls in the notification shade. *   [C-3-6] MUST allocate the following minimum width and height for the PIP     window when an application does not declare any value for     [`AndroidManifestLayout_minWidth`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html#AndroidManifestLayout_minWidth)     and [`AndroidManifestLayout_minHeight`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable.html#AndroidManifestLayout_minHeight):      *   Devices with the Configuration.uiMode that is set other than     [`UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION)     MUST allocate a minimum width and height of 108 dp.     *   Devices with the Configuration.uiMode that is set to     [`UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html#UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION)     MUST allocate a minimum width of 240 dp and a minimum height of 135 dp.  ### 3.8.15\. Display Cutout  Android supports a Display Cutout as described in the SDK document. The [`DisplayCutout`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/DisplayCutout) API defines an area on the edge of the display that may not be functional for an application due to a display cutout or curved display on the edge(s).  If device implementations include display cutout(s), they:  *   [C-1-5] MUST NOT have cutout(s) if the device's aspect ratio is 1.0(1:1). *   [C-1-2] MUST NOT have more than one cutout per edge. *   [C-1-3] MUST honor the display cutout flags set by the app through the [`WindowManager.LayoutParams`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams) API as described in the SDK. *   [C-1-4] MUST report correct values for all cutout metrics defined in the [`DisplayCutout`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/DisplayCutout) API.  ### 3.8.16\. Device Controls  Android includes [`ControlsProviderService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/controls/ControlsProviderService) and [`Control`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/controls/Control) APIs to allow third-party applications to publish device controls for quick status and action for users.

Device Administration  Android includes features that allow security-aware applications to perform device administration functions at the system level, such as enforcing password policies or performing remote wipe, through the [Android Device Administration API](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html).  If device implementations implement the full range of [device administration]( http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html) policies defined in the Android SDK documentation, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST declare `android.software.device_admin`. *   [C-1-2] MUST support device owner provisioning as described in     [section 3.9.1](#3_9_1_device_provisioning) and     [section 3.9.1.1](#3_9_1_1_device_owner_provisioning).  ### 3.9.1 Device Provisioning  #### 3.9.1.1 Device owner provisioning  If device implementations declare `android.software.device_admin`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST support enrolling a Device Policy Client (DPC) as a     [Device Owner app](     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#isDeviceOwnerApp%28java.lang.String%29)     as described below:     *   When the device implementation has no user data is configured yet, it:         *    [C-1-3] MUST report `true` for [`DevicePolicyManager.isProvisioningAllowed(ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html\#isProvisioningAllowed\(java.lang.String\)).         *    [C-1-4] MUST enroll the DPC application as the Device Owner app in              response to the intent action [`android.app.action.PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE).         *    [C-1-5] MUST enroll the DPC application as the Device Owner app if the              device declares Near-Field Communications (NFC) support via the feature              flag `android.hardware.nfc` and receives an NFC message containing a              record with MIME type [`MIME_TYPE_PROVISIONING_NFC`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#MIME_TYPE_PROVISIONING_NFC).     *   When the device implementation has user data, it:         *    [C-1-6] MUST report `false` for the [`DevicePolicyManager.isProvisioningAllowed(ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html\#isProvisioningAllowed\(java.lang.String\)).         *    [C-1-7] MUST not enroll any DPC application as the Device Owner App              any more. *   [C-1-2] MUST require some affirmative action before or during the     provisioning process to consent to the app being set as Device Owner.

Also, the programmatic device owner consent     mechanism used (by enterprises) for device owner provisioning MUST NOT     interfere with the Out-Of-Box Experience for non-enterprise use.  *   [C-1-3] MUST NOT hard code the consent or prevent the use of other device     owner apps.  If device implementations declare `android.software.device_admin`, but also include a proprietary Device Owner management solution and provide a mechanism to promote an application configured in their solution as a ""Device Owner equivalent"" to the standard ""Device Owner"" as recognized by the standard Android [DevicePolicyManager]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html) APIs, they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST have a process in place to verify that the specific app      being promoted belongs to a legitimate enterprise device management      solution and it has been already configured in the proprietary solution      to have the rights equivalent as a ""Device Owner"". *    [C-2-2] MUST show the same AOSP Device Owner consent disclosure as the      flow initiated by [`android.app.action.PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_DEVICE)      prior to enrolling the DPC application as ""Device Owner"". *    MAY have user data on the device prior to enrolling the DPC application      as ""Device Owner"".  #### 3.9.1.2 Managed profile provisioning  If device implementations declare `android.software.managed_users`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST implement the [APIs](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE) allowing a Device Policy Controller (DPC) application to become the [owner of a new Managed Profile](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#isProfileOwnerApp%28java.lang.String%29).  *   [C-1-2] The managed profile provisioning process (the flow initiated by [android.app.action.PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE)) users experience MUST align with the AOSP implementation.  *   [C-1-3] MUST provide the following user affordances within the Settings to     indicate to the user when a particular system function has been disabled by     the Device Policy Controller (DPC):     *   A consistent icon or other user affordance (for example the upstream         AOSP info icon) to represent when a particular setting is restricted by         a Device Admin.     *   A short explanation message, as provided by the Device Admin via the         [`setShortSupportMessage`](         https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setShortSupportMessage%28android.content.ComponentName, java.lang.CharSequence%29).     *   The DPC application’s icon.  ### 3.9.2 Managed Profile Support  If device implementations declare `android.software.managed_users`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST support managed profiles via the `android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager`     APIs. *   [C-1-2] MUST allow one and only [one managed profile to be created](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE). *   [C-1-3] MUST use an icon badge (similar to the AOSP upstream work badge) to     represent the managed applications and widgets and other badged UI elements     like Recents &amp; Notifications. *   [C-1-4] MUST display a notification icon (similar to the AOSP upstream work     badge) to indicate when user is within a managed profile application. *   [C-1-5] MUST display a toast indicating that the user is in the managed     profile if and when the device wakes up (ACTION_USER_PRESENT) and the     foreground application is within the managed profile. *   [C-1-6] Where a managed profile exists, MUST show a visual affordance in the     Intent 'Chooser' to allow the user to forward the intent from the managed     profile to the primary user or vice versa, if enabled by the Device Policy     Controller. *   [C-1-7] Where a managed profile exists, MUST expose the following user     affordances for both the primary user and the managed profile:     *   Separate accounting for battery, location, mobile data and storage usage         for the primary user and managed profile.     *   Independent management of VPN Applications installed within the primary         user or managed profile.     *   Independent management of applications installed within the primary user         or managed profile.     *   Independent management of accounts within the primary user or managed         profile. *   [C-1-8] MUST ensure the preinstalled dialer, contacts and messaging     applications can search for and look up caller information from the managed     profile (if one exists) alongside those from the primary profile, if the     Device Policy Controller permits it. *   [C-1-9] MUST ensure that it satisfies all the security requirements     applicable for a device with multiple users enabled     (see [section 9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)), even though the managed profile     is not counted as another user in addition to the primary user.  If device implementations declare `android.software.managed_users` and `android.software.secure_lock_screen`, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST support the ability to specify a separate lock screen meeting     the following requirements to grant access to apps running in a managed     profile only.     *   Device implementations MUST honor the         [`DevicePolicyManager.ACTION_SET_NEW_PASSWORD`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#ACTION_SET_NEW_PASSWORD)         intent and show an interface to configure a separate lock screen         credential for the managed profile.     *   The lock screen credentials of the managed profile MUST use the same         credential storage and management mechanisms as the parent profile,         as documented on the         [Android Open Source Project Site](http://source.android.com/security/authentication/index.html).     *   The DPC [password policies](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html#pwd)         MUST apply to only the managed profile's lock screen credentials unless         called upon the `DevicePolicyManager` instance returned by         <a href=""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#getParentProfileInstance%28android.content.ComponentName%29"">getParentProfileInstance</a>. *   When contacts from the managed profile are displayed     in the preinstalled call log, in-call UI, in-progress and missed-call     notifications, contacts and messaging apps they SHOULD be badged with the     same badge used to indicate managed profile applications.  ### 3.9.3 Managed User Support  If device implementations declare `android.software.managed_users`, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST provide a user affordance to logout from the current user and     switch back to the primary user in multiple-user session when     [`isLogoutEnabled`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#isLogoutEnabled%28%29)     returns `true`.

Application Binary Interfaces  Managed Dalvik bytecode can call into native code provided in the application `.apk` file as an ELF `.so` file compiled for the appropriate device hardware architecture. As native code is highly dependent on the underlying processor technology, Android defines a number of Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) in the Android NDK.

Intent Compatibility  #### 3.2.3.1\. Common Application Intents  Android intents allow application components to request functionality from other Android components. The Android upstream project includes a list of applications which implement several intent patterns to perform common actions.  Device implementations:  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to preload one or more applications or service components with an intent handler, for all the public intent filter patterns defined by the following application intents listed [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/common-intents-30) and provide fulfillment i.e meet with the developer expectation for these common application intents as described in the SDK.  Please refer to [Section 2](#2_device_types) for mandatory application intents for each device type.  #### 3.2.3.2\. Intent Resolution  *   [C-0-1] As Android is an extensible platform, device implementations MUST allow each intent pattern referenced in [section 3.2.3.1](#3_2_3_1_common_application_intents) , except for Settings, to be overridden by third-party applications. The upstream Android open source implementation allows this by default.  *   [C-0-2] Device implementers MUST NOT attach special privileges to system applications' use of these intent patterns, or prevent third-party applications from binding to and assuming control of these patterns. This prohibition specifically includes but is not limited to disabling the “Chooser” user interface that allows the user to select between multiple applications that all handle the same intent pattern.  *   [C-0-3] Device implementations MUST provide a user interface for users to modify the default activity for intents.  *   However, device implementations MAY provide default activities for specific URI patterns (e.g. http://play.google.com) when the default activity provides a more specific attribute for the data URI. For example, an intent filter pattern specifying the data URI “http://www.android.com” is more specific than the browser's core intent pattern for “http://”.  Android also includes a mechanism for third-party apps to declare an authoritative default [app linking behavior](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) for certain types of web URI intents. When such authoritative declarations are defined in an app's intent filter patterns, device implementations:  *   [C-0-4] MUST attempt to validate any intent filters by performing the validation steps defined in the [Digital Asset Links specification](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links) as implemented by the Package Manager in the upstream Android Open Source Project. *   [C-0-5] MUST attempt validation of the intent filters during the installation of the application and set all successfully validated URI intent filters as default app handlers for their URIs. *   MAY set specific URI intent filters as default app handlers for their URIs, if they are successfully verified but other candidate URI filters fail verification. If a device implementation does this, it MUST provide the user appropriate per-URI pattern overrides in the settings menu. *   MUST provide the user with per-app App Links controls in Settings as follows:       *   [C-0-6] The user MUST be able to override holistically the default app       links behavior for an app to be: always open, always ask, or never open,       which must apply to all candidate URI intent filters equally.       *   [C-0-7] The user MUST be able to see a list of the candidate URI intent       filters.       *   The device implementation MAY provide the user with the ability to       override specific candidate URI intent filters that were successfully       verified, on a per-intent filter basis.       *   [C-0-8] The device implementation MUST provide users with the ability to       view and override specific candidate URI intent filters if the device       implementation lets some candidate URI intent filters succeed       verification while some others can fail.  #### 3.2.3.3\. Intent Namespaces  *   [C-0-1] Device implementations MUST NOT include any Android component that honors any new intent or broadcast intent patterns using an ACTION, CATEGORY, or other key string in the android.* or com.android.* namespace. *   [C-0-2] Device implementers MUST NOT include any Android components that honor any new intent or broadcast intent patterns using an ACTION, CATEGORY, or other key string in a package space belonging to another organization. *   [C-0-3] Device implementers MUST NOT alter or extend any of the intent patterns listed in [section 3.2.3.1](#3_2_3_1_common_application_intents). *   Device implementations MAY include intent patterns using namespaces clearly and obviously associated with their own organization. This prohibition is analogous to that specified for Java language classes in [section 3.6](#3_6_api_namespaces).  #### 3.2.3.4\. Broadcast Intents  Third-party applications rely on the platform to broadcast certain intents to notify them of changes in the hardware or software environment.  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST broadcast the public broadcast intents listed [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/reference/broadcast-intents-30) in response to appropriate system events as described in the SDK documentation. Note that this requirement is not conflicting with section 3.5 as the limitation for background applications are also described in the SDK documentation. Also certain broadcast intents are conditional upon hardware support, if the device supports the necessary hardware they MUST broadcast the intents and provide the behavior inline with SDK documentation.  #### 3.2.3.5\. Conditional Application Intents  Android includes settings that provide users an easy way to select their default applications, for example for Home screen or SMS.

If the navigation function is provided as an on-screen, gesture-based action:  *   [[7.2](#7_2_input_devices).3/H] The gesture recognition zone for the Home     function SHOULD be no higher than 32 dp in height from the bottom of the     screen.  If Handheld device implementations provide a navigation function as a gesture from anywhere on the left and right edges of the screen:  *   [[7.2](#7_2_input_devices).3/H-0-1] The navigation function's gesture area     MUST be less than 40 dp in width on each side. The gesture area SHOULD be     24 dp in width by default.  ### 2.2.4\. Performance and Power  *   [[8.1](#8_1_user_experience_consistency)/H-0-1] **Consistent frame latency**. Inconsistent frame latency or a delay to render frames MUST NOT happen more often than 5 frames in a second, and SHOULD be below 1 frames in a second. *   [[8.1](#8_1_user_experience_consistency)/H-0-2] **User interface latency**. Device implementations MUST ensure low latency user experience by scrolling a list of 10K list entries as defined by the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) in less than 36 secs. *   [[8.1](#8_1_user_experience_consistency)/H-0-3] **Task switching**. When multiple applications have been launched, re-launching an already-running application after it has been launched MUST take less than 1 second.  Handheld device implementations:  *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/H-0-1] MUST ensure a sequential write performance of at least 5 MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/H-0-2] MUST ensure a random write performance of at least 0.5 MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/H-0-3] MUST ensure a sequential read performance of at least 15 MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/H-0-4] MUST ensure a random read performance of at least 3.5 MB/s.  If Handheld device implementations include features to improve device power management that are included in AOSP or extend the features that are included in AOSP, they:  * [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/H-1-1] MUST provide user affordance to enable   and disable the battery saver feature. * [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/H-1-2] MUST provide user affordance to display   all apps that are exempted from App Standby and Doze power-saving modes.  Handheld device implementations:  *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H-0-1] MUST provide a per-component power profile that defines the [current consumption value]( http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html) for each hardware component and the approximate battery drain caused by the components over time as documented in the Android Open Source Project site. *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H-0-2] MUST report all power consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh). *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H-0-3] MUST report CPU power consumption per each process's UID. The Android Open Source Project meets the requirement through the `uid_cputime` kernel module implementation. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H-0-4] MUST make this power usage available via the [`adb shell dumpsys batterystats`]( http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batterystats.html) shell command to the app developer. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H] SHOULD be attributed to the hardware component itself if unable to attribute hardware component power usage to an application.  If Handheld device implementations include a screen or video output, they:  *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/H-1-1] MUST honor the [`android.intent.action.POWER_USAGE_SUMMARY`]( http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_POWER_USAGE_SUMMARY) intent and display a settings menu that shows this power usage.  ### 2.2.5\. Security Model  Handheld device implementations:  *   [[9.1](#9_1_permissions)/H-0-1] MUST allow third-party apps to access the usage statistics via the `android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission and provide a user-accessible mechanism to grant or revoke access to such apps in response to the [`android.settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION&lowbar;USAGE&lowbar;ACCESS&lowbar;SETTINGS) intent.  Handheld device implementations (\* Not applicable for Tablet):  *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-0-2]\* MUST back up the keystore implementation      with an isolated execution environment. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-0-3]\* MUST have implementations of RSA, AES,      ECDSA, and HMAC cryptographic algorithms and MD5, SHA1, and SHA-2 family      hash functions to properly support the Android Keystore system's supported      algorithms in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on      the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms      by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the      isolated environment, including DMA. The upstream Android Open Source      Project (AOSP) meets this requirement by using the [Trusty](      https://source.android.com/security/trusty/) implementation, but another      ARM TrustZone-based solution or a third-party reviewed secure      implementation of a proper hypervisor-based isolation are alternative      options. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-0-4]\* MUST perform the lock screen      authentication in the isolated execution environment and only when      successful, allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. Lock screen      credentials MUST be stored in a way that allows only the isolated execution      environment to perform lock screen authentication. The upstream Android      Open Source Project provides the      [Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](      http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html)      and Trusty, which can be used to satisfy this requirement. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-0-5]\* MUST support key attestation where the      attestation signing key is protected by secure hardware and signing is      performed in secure hardware. The attestation signing keys MUST be shared      across large enough number of devices to prevent the keys from being used      as device identifiers. One way of meeting this requirement is to share the      same attestation key unless at least 100,000 units of a given SKU are      produced. If more than 100,000 units of an SKU are produced, a different      key MAY be used for each 100,000 units.  Note that if a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version, such a device is exempted from the requirement to have a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment and support the key attestation, unless it declares the `android.hardware.fingerprint` feature which requires a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment.  When Handheld device implementations support a secure lock screen, they:  *   [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-1-1] MUST allow the user to choose the shortest     sleep timeout, that is a transition time from the unlocked to the locked     state, as 15 seconds or less. *   [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/H-1-2] MUST provide user affordance to hide     notifications and disable all forms of authentication except for the     primary authentication described in     [9.11.1 Secure Lock Screen](#9_11_1_secure-lock-screen). The AOSP meets the     requirement as lockdown mode.  ### 2.2.6\. Developer Tools and Options Compatibility  Handheld device implementations (\* Not applicable for Tablet):  *   [[6.1](#6_1_developer_tools)/H-0-1]\* MUST support the shell command     `cmd testharness`.

Television device implementations:  *    [[3.12](#3_12_tv_input_framework)/T-0-1] MUST support TV Input Framework.   ### 2.3.4\. Performance and Power  *   [[8.1](#8_1_user_experience_consistency)/T-0-1] **Consistent frame latency**.    Inconsistent frame latency or a delay to render frames MUST NOT happen more    often than 5 frames in a second, and SHOULD be below 1 frames in a second. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/T-0-1] MUST ensure a sequential    write performance of at least 5MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/T-0-2] MUST ensure a random write    performance of at least 0.5MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/T-0-3] MUST ensure a sequential    read performance of at least 15MB/s. *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_io_access_performance)/T-0-4] MUST ensure a random read    performance of at least 3.5MB/s.  If Television device implementations include features to improve device power management that are included in AOSP or extend the features that are included in AOSP, they:  * [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/T-1-1] MUST provide user affordance to enable   and disable the battery saver feature.  If Television device implementations do not have a battery they:  * [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/T-1-2] MUST register the device as a batteryless device as described in [Supporting Batteryless Devices]( https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batteryless).  If Television device implementations have a battery they:  * [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/T-1-3] MUST provide user affordance to display   all apps that are exempted from App Standby and Doze power-saving modes.  Television device implementations:  *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/T-0-1] MUST provide a per-component power profile that defines the [current consumption value]( http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html) for each hardware component and the approximate battery drain caused by the components over time as documented in the Android Open Source Project site. *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/T-0-2] MUST report all power consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh). *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/T-0-3] MUST report CPU power consumption per each process's UID. The Android Open Source Project meets the requirement through the `uid_cputime` kernel module implementation. *    [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/T] SHOULD be attributed to the hardware component itself if unable to attribute hardware component power usage to an application. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/T-0-4] MUST make this power usage available via the [`adb shell dumpsys batterystats`]( http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batterystats.html) shell command to the app developer.  ### 2.3.5\. Security Model  Television device implementations:  *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/T-0-1] MUST back up the keystore implementation      with an isolated execution environment. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/T-0-2] MUST have implementations of RSA, AES,      ECDSA and HMAC cryptographic algorithms and MD5, SHA1, and SHA-2 family      hash functions to properly support the Android Keystore system's supported      algorithms in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on      the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms      by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the      isolated environment, including DMA. The upstream Android Open Source      Project (AOSP) meets this requirement by using the [Trusty](      https://source.android.com/security/trusty/) implementation, but another      ARM TrustZone-based solution or a third-party reviewed secure      implementation of a proper hypervisor-based isolation are alternative      options. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/T-0-3] MUST perform the lock screen      authentication in the isolated execution environment and only when      successful, allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. Lock screen      credentials MUST be stored in a way that allows only the isolated execution      environment to perform lock screen authentication. The upstream Android      Open Source Project provides the      [Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](      http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html)      and Trusty, which can be used to satisfy this requirement. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/T-0-4] MUST support key attestation where the      attestation signing key is protected by secure hardware and signing is      performed in secure hardware. The attestation signing keys MUST be shared      across large enough number of devices to prevent the keys from being used      as device identifiers. One way of meeting this requirement is to share the      same attestation key unless at least 100,000 units of a given SKU are      produced. If more than 100,000 units of an SKU are produced, a different      key MAY be used for each 100,000 units.  Note that if a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version, such a device is exempted from the requirement to have a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment and support the key attestation, unless it declares the `android.hardware.fingerprint` feature which requires a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment.  If Television device implementations support a secure lock screen, they:  *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/T-1-1] MUST allow the user to choose the Sleep      timeout for transition from the unlocked to the locked state, with a      minimum allowable timeout up to 15 seconds or less.  ### 2.3.6\.

Performance and Power  Automotive device implementations:  *   [[8.2](#8_2_file_i/o_access_performance)/A-0-1] MUST report the number of bytes read and written to non-volatile storage per each process's UID so the stats are available to developers through System API `android.car.storagemonitoring.CarStorageMonitoringManager`. The Android Open Source Project meets the requirement through the `uid_sys_stats` kernel module. *   [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/A-1-3] MUST support [Garage Mode](     https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/garage_mode). *   [[8.3](#8_3_power_saving_modes)/A] SHOULD be in Garage Mode for at least     15 minutes after every drive unless:     *    The battery is drained.     *    No idle jobs are scheduled.     *    The driver exits Garage Mode. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-1] MUST provide a per-component power profile that defines the [current consumption value](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html) for each hardware component and the approximate battery drain caused by the components over time as documented in the Android Open Source Project site. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-2] MUST report all power consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh). *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-3] MUST report CPU power consumption per each process's UID. The Android Open Source Project meets the requirement through the `uid_cputime` kernel module implementation. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A] SHOULD be attributed to the hardware component itself if unable to attribute hardware component power usage to an application. *   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-4] MUST make this power usage available via the [`adb shell dumpsys batterystats`](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/batterystats.html) shell command to the app developer.  ### 2.5.5\. Security Model  If Automotive device implementations support multiple users, they:  *   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-1] MUST NOT allow users to interact with nor switch into the [Headless System User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types), except for [device provisioning](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/provision). *   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-2] MUST switch into a [Secondary User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types) before [`BOOT_COMPLETED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED). *   [[9.5](#9_5_multi-user_support)/A-1-3] MUST support the ability to create a [Guest User](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user#user_types) even when the maximum number of Users on a device has been reached.   Automotive device implementations:  *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-1] MUST back up the keystore implementation      with an isolated execution environment. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-2] MUST have implementations of RSA, AES,      ECDSA and HMAC cryptographic algorithms and MD5, SHA1, and SHA-2 family      hash functions to properly support the Android Keystore system's supported      algorithms in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on      the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms      by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the      isolated environment, including DMA. The upstream Android Open Source      Project (AOSP) meets this requirement by using the [Trusty](      https://source.android.com/security/trusty/) implementation, but another      ARM TrustZone-based solution or a third-party reviewed secure      implementation of a proper hypervisor-based isolation are alternative      options. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-3] MUST perform the lock screen      authentication in the isolated execution environment and only when      successful, allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. Lock screen      credentials MUST be stored in a way that allows only the isolated execution      environment to perform lock screen authentication. The upstream Android      Open Source Project provides the      [Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](      http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html)      and Trusty, which can be used to satisfy this requirement. *    [[9.11](#9_11_permissions)/A-0-4] MUST support key attestation where the      attestation signing key is protected by secure hardware and signing is      performed in secure hardware. The attestation signing keys MUST be shared      across large enough number of devices to prevent the keys from being used      as device identifiers. One way of meeting this requirement is to share the      same attestation key unless at least 100,000 units of a given SKU are      produced. If more than 100,000 units of an SKU are produced, a different      key MAY be used for each 100,000 units.  Note that if a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version, such a device is exempted from the requirement to have a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment and support the key attestation, unless it declares the `android.hardware.fingerprint` feature which requires a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment.  Automotive device implementations:  *   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-1] MUST gatekeep messages from Android framework vehicle subsystems, e.g., whitelisting permitted message types and message sources. *   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-2] MUST watchdog against denial of service attacks from the Android framework or third-party apps. This guards against malicious software flooding the vehicle network with traffic, which may lead to malfunctioning vehicle subsystems.  ### 2.5.6\.

Devices which launched on an API level earlier than that of this document are exempted from the requirements of sections 9.9.2 and 9.9.3; instead they MUST meet the requirements in section 9.9 of the Android Compatibility Definition document corresponding to the API level on which the device launched.  ### 9.9.1\. Direct Boot  Device implementations:  *    [C-0-1] MUST implement the [Direct Boot mode]( http://developer.android.com/preview/features/direct-boot.html) APIs even if they do not support Storage Encryption.  *     [C-0-2] The [`ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED) and [`ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED) Intents MUST still be broadcast to signal Direct Boot aware applications that Device Encrypted (DE) and Credential Encrypted (CE) storage locations are available for user.  ### 9.9.2\. Encryption requirements  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST encrypt the application private data (`/data` partition), as well as the application shared storage partition (`/sdcard` partition) if it is a permanent, non-removable part of the device. *   [C-0-2] MUST enable the data storage encryption by default at the time the user has completed the out-of-box setup experience. *   [C-0-3] MUST meet the above data storage encryption requirement via implementing [File Based Encryption]( https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based.html) (FBE) and [Metadata Encryption](https://source.android.com/security/encryption/metadata).  ### 9.9.3\. Encryption Methods  If device implementations are encrypted, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST boot up without challenging the user for credentials and allow Direct Boot aware apps to access to the Device Encrypted (DE) storage after the `ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` message is broadcasted. *    [C-1-2] MUST only allow access to Credential Encrypted (CE) storage after the user has unlocked the device by supplying their credentials (eg. passcode, pin, pattern or fingerprint) and the `ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED` message is broadcasted. *    [C-1-13] MUST NOT offer any method to unlock the CE protected storage without either the user-supplied credentials, a registered escrow key or a resume on reboot implementation meeting the requirements in [section 9.9.4](#9_9_4_resume_on_reboot). *    [C-1-4] MUST use Verified Boot. *    [C-1-5] MUST encrypt file contents and filesystem metadata using AES-256-XTS or Adiantum.  AES-256-XTS refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit cipher key length, operated in XTS mode; the full length of the key is 512 bits.  Adiantum refers to Adiantum-XChaCha12-AES, as specified at https://github.com/google/adiantum. Filesystem metadata is data such as file sizes, ownership, modes, and extended attributes (xattrs). *    [C-1-6] MUST encrypt file names using AES-256-CBC-CTS or Adiantum. *    [C-1-12] If the device has Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) instructions (such as ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions on ARM-based devices, or AES-NI on x86-based devices) then the AES-based options above for file name, file contents, and filesystem metadata encryption MUST be used, not Adiantum. *    [C-1-13] MUST use a cryptographically strong and non-reversible key derivation function (e.g. HKDF-SHA512) to derive any needed subkeys (e.g. per-file keys) from the CE and DE keys.  ""Cryptographically strong and non-reversible"" means that the key derivation function has a security strength of at least 256 bits and behaves as a [pseudorandom function family](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudorandom_function_family&oldid=928163524) over its inputs. *    [C-1-14] MUST NOT use the same File Based Encryption (FBE) keys or subkeys for different cryptographic purposes (e.g. for both encryption and key derivation, or for two different encryption algorithms).  *   The keys protecting CE and DE storage areas and filesystem metadata:     *   [C-1-7] MUST be cryptographically bound to a hardware-backed Keystore.    This keystore MUST be bound to Verified Boot and the device's hardware    root of trust.    *   [C-1-8] CE keys MUST be bound to a user's lock screen credentials.    *   [C-1-9] CE keys MUST be bound to a default passcode when the user has not specified lock screen credentials.    *   [C-1-10] MUST be unique and distinct, in other words no user's CE or DE    key matches any other user's CE or DE keys.    *    [C-1-11] MUST use the mandatorily supported ciphers, key lengths and    modes.  *    SHOULD make preinstalled essential apps (e.g. Alarm, Phone, Messenger) Direct Boot aware.  The upstream Android Open Source project provides a preferred implementation of File Based Encryption based on the Linux kernel ""fscrypt"" encryption feature, and of Metadata Encryption based on the Linux kernel ""dm-default-key"" feature.  ### 9.9.4\. Resume on Reboot  Resume on Reboot allows unlocking the CE storage of all apps, including those that do not yet support Direct Boot, after a reboot initiated by an OTA. This feature enables users to receive notifications from installed apps after the reboot.  An implementation of Resume-on-Reboot must continue to ensure that when a device falls into an attacker’s hands, it is extremely difficult for that attacker to recover the user’s CE-encrypted data, even if the device is powered on, CE storage is unlocked, and the user has unlocked the device after receiving an OTA. For insider attack resistance, we also assume the attacker gains access to broadcast cryptographic signing keys.  Specifically:  *   [C-0-1] CE storage MUST NOT be readable even for the attacker who physically has the device and then has these capabilities and limitations:      *   Can use the signing key of any vendor or company to sign arbitrary         messages.     *   Can cause an OTA to be received by the device.     *   Can modify the operation of any hardware (AP, flash etc) except as         detailed below, but such modification involves a delay of at least an         hour and a power cycle that destroys RAM contents.     *   Cannot modify the operation of tamper-resistant hardware (eg Titan M).     *   Cannot read the RAM of the live device.     *   Cannot obtain the user’s credential (PIN, pattern, password) or         otherwise cause it to be entered.  By way of example, a device implementation that implements and complies with all of the descriptions found [here](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/resume-on-reboot) will be compliant with [C-0-1].

"9_7_security-features"	"9.7"	""	"09070000.48"	"9.7"	"""## 9.7\. Security Features Device implementations MUST ensure compliance with security features in both the kernel and platform as described below.  The Android Sandbox includes features that use the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) mandatory access control (MAC) system, seccomp sandboxing, and other security features in the Linux kernel. Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST maintain compatibility with existing applications, even when SELinux or any other security features are implemented below the Android framework. *   [C-0-2] MUST NOT have a visible user interface when a security violation is detected and successfully blocked by the security feature implemented below the Android framework, but MAY have a visible user interface when an unblocked security violation occurs resulting in a successful exploit. *   [C-0-3] MUST NOT make SELinux or any other security features implemented below the Android framework configurable to the user or app developer. *   [C-0-4]  MUST NOT allow an application that can affect another application through an API (such as a Device Administration API) to configure a policy that breaks compatibility. *   [C-0-5] MUST split the media framework into multiple processes so that it is possible to more narrowly grant access for each process as [described](https://source.android.com/devices/media/framework-hardening.html#arch_changes) in the Android Open Source Project site. *   [C-0-6] MUST implement a kernel application sandboxing mechanism which allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy from multithreaded programs. The upstream Android Open Source Project meets this requirement through enabling the seccomp-BPF with threadgroup synchronization (TSYNC) as described [in the Kernel Configuration section of source.android.com](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/kernel.html#Seccomp-BPF-TSYNC).  Kernel integrity and self-protection features are integral to Android security. Device implementations:  *   [C-0-7] MUST implement kernel stack buffer overflow protection mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms are `CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR` and `CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG`. *   [C-0-8] MUST implement strict kernel memory protections where executable code is read-only, read-only data is non-executable and non-writable, and writable data is non-executable (e.g. `CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA` or `CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX`). *   [C-0-9] MUST implement static and dynamic object size bounds checking of copies between user-space and kernel-space (e.g. `CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY`) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. *   [C-0-10] MUST NOT execute user-space memory when executing in the kernel mode (e.g. hardware PXN, or emulated via `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` or `CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN`) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. *   [C-0-11] MUST NOT read or write user-space memory in the kernel outside of normal usercopy access APIs (e.g. hardware PAN, or emulated via `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` or `CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN`) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. *   [C-0-12] MUST implement kernel page table isolation if the hardware is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5754 on all devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher (e.g. `CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION` or `CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0`). *   [C-0-13] MUST implement branch prediction hardening if the hardware is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 on all devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher (e.g. `CONFIG_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR`). *   [SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep kernel data which is written only during initialization marked read-only after initialization (e.g. `__ro_after_init`). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to randomize the layout of the kernel code and memory, and to avoid exposures that would compromise the randomization (e.g. `CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE` with bootloader entropy via the [`/chosen/kaslr-seed Device Tree node`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/chosen.txt) or [`EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/efi-rng-protocol)).  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable control flow integrity (CFI) in the kernel to provide additional protection against code-reuse attacks (e.g. `CONFIG_CFI_CLANG` and `CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK`). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED not to disable Control-Flow Integrity (CFI), Shadow Call Stack (SCS) or Integer Overflow Sanitization (IntSan) on components that have it enabled. *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable CFI, SCS, and IntSan for any additional security-sensitive userspace components as explained in [CFI](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/cfi) and [IntSan](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/intsan). *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable stack initialization in the kernel to prevent uses of uninitialized local variables (`CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL` or `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO`).

Usage History  Android stores the history of the user's choices and manages such history by [UsageStatsManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageStatsManager.html).  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST keep a reasonable retention period of such user history. *   [SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep the 14 days retention period as     configured by default in the AOSP implementation.  Android stores the system events using the [`StatsLog`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/StatsLog.html) identifiers, and manages such history via the `StatsManager` and the `IncidentManager` System API.  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-2] MUST only include the fields marked with `DEST_AUTOMATIC` in the     incident report created by the System API class `IncidentManager`. *   [C-0-3] MUST not use the system event identifiers to log any other event     than what is described in the [`StatsLog`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/StatsLog.html)     SDK documents. If additional system events are logged, they MAY use a     different atom identifier in the range between 100,000 and 200,000.  ### 9.8.2\. Recording  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST NOT preload or distribute software components out-of-box that     send the user's private information (e.g. keystrokes, text displayed on the     screen, bugreport) off the device without the user's consent or clear     ongoing notifications. *   [C-0-2] MUST display and obtain explicit user consent that includes exactly     the same message as AOSP whenever screen casting or screen recording is     enabled via [`MediaProjection`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection)     or proprietary APIs. MUST NOT provide users an affordance to     disable future display of the user consent. *   [C-0-3] MUST have an ongoing notification to the user while screen casting     or screen recording is enabled. AOSP meets this requirement by showing an     ongoing notification icon in the status bar.  If device implementations include functionality in the system that either captures the contents displayed on the screen and/or records the audio stream played on the device other than via the System API `ContentCaptureService`, or other proprietary means described in [Section 9.8.6 Content Capture](#9_8_6_content_capture), they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST have an ongoing notification to the user whenever this     functionality is enabled and actively capturing/recording.  If device implementations include a component enabled out-of-box, capable of recording ambient audio and/or record the audio played on the device to infer useful information about user’s context, they:  *   [C-2-1] MUST NOT store in persistent on-device storage or transmit off the     device the recorded raw audio or any format that can be converted back into     the original audio or a near facsimile, except with explicit user consent.  ### 9.8.3\. Connectivity  If device implementations have a USB port with USB peripheral mode support, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST present a user interface asking for the user's consent before allowing access to the contents of the shared storage over the USB port.   ### 9.8.4\. Network Traffic  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST preinstall the same root certificates for the system-trusted     Certificate Authority (CA) store as [provided](https://source.android.com/security/overview/app-security.html#certificate-authorities)     in the upstream Android Open Source Project. *   [C-0-2] MUST ship with an empty user root CA store. *   [C-0-3] MUST display a warning to the user indicating the network traffic     may be monitored, when a user root CA is added.  If device traffic is routed through a VPN, device implementations:  *   [C-1-1] MUST display a warning to the user indicating either:     *   That network traffic may be monitored.     *   That network traffic is being routed through the specific VPN         application providing the VPN.  If device implementations have a mechanism, enabled out-of-box by default, that routes network data traffic through a proxy server or VPN gateway (for example, preloading a VPN service with `android.permission.CONTROL_VPN` granted), they:  *    [C-2-1] MUST ask for the user's consent before enabling that mechanism,      unless that VPN is enabled by the Device Policy Controller via the      [`DevicePolicyManager.setAlwaysOnVpnPackage()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setAlwaysOnVpnPackage%28android.content.ComponentName, java.lang.String, boolean%29)      , in which case the user does not need to provide a separate consent, but      MUST only be notified.  If device implementations implement a user affordance to toggle on the ""always-on VPN"" function of a 3rd-party VPN app, they:  *    [C-3-1] MUST disable this user affordance for apps that do not support      always-on VPN service in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file via setting the      [`SERVICE_META_DATA_SUPPORTS_ALWAYS_ON`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService.html#SERVICE_META_DATA_SUPPORTS_ALWAYS_ON)      attribute to `false`.  ### 9.8.5\. Device Identifiers  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST prevent access to the device serial number and, where     applicable, IMEI/MEID, SIM serial number, and International Mobile     Subscriber Identity (IMSI) from an app, unless it meets one of the following     requirements:     * is a signed carrier app that is verified by device manufacturers.     * has been granted the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.     * has carrier privileges as defined in [`UICC Carrier Privileges`](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/uicc).     * is a device owner or profile owner that has been granted the       `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission.  ### 9.8.6\. Content Capture  Android, through the System API `ContentCaptureService`, or by other proprietary means, supports a mechanism for device implementations to capture the following interactions between the applications and the user.  *    Text and graphics rendered on-screen, including but not limited to,      notifications and assist data via [`AssistStructure`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/assist/AssistStructure)      API. *    Media data, such as audio or video, recorded or played by the device. *    Input events (e.g. key, mouse, gesture, voice, video, and accessibility). *    Any other events that an application provides to the system via the      [`Content Capture`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/contentcapture/package-summary)      API or a similarly capable, proprietary API. *    Any text or other data sent via the [`TextClassifier API`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/textclassifier/TextClassifier)      to the System TextClassifier i.e to the system service to understand      the meaning of text, as well as generating predicted next actions based on      the text.  If device implementations capture the data above, they:  *    [C-0-1] MUST encrypt all such data when stored in the device. This      encryption MAY be carried out using Android File Based Encryption, or any      of the ciphers listed as API version 26+ described in [Cipher SDK](      https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher). *    [C-0-2] MUST NOT back up either raw or encrypted data using      [Android backup methods](      https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup) or any other back      up methods. *    [C-0-3] MUST only send all such data and the log of the device using a      privacy-preserving mechanism. The privacy-preserving mechanism      is defined as “those which allow only analysis in aggregate and prevent      matching of logged events or derived outcomes to individual users”, to      prevent any per-user data being introspectable (e.g., implemented using      a differential privacy technology such as [`RAPPOR`](      https://github.com/google/rappor)). *    [C-0-4] MUST NOT associate such data with any user identity (such      as [`Account`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/Account))      on the device, except with explicit user consent each time the data is      associated. *    [C-0-5] MUST NOT share such data with other apps, except with      explicit user consent every time it is shared. *    [C-0-6] MUST provide user affordance to erase such data that      the `ContentCaptureService` or the proprietary means collects if the      data is stored in any form on the device.  If device implementations include a service that implements the System API `ContentCaptureService`, or any proprietary service that captures the data as described as above, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST NOT allow users to replace the content capture service with a      user-installable application or service and MUST only allow the      preinstalled service to capture such data. *    [C-1-2] MUST NOT allow any apps other than the preinstalled content capture      service mechanism to be able to capture such data. *    [C-1-3] MUST provide user affordance to disable the content capture      service. *    [C-1-4] MUST NOT omit user affordance to manage Android permissions that      are held by the content capture service and follow Android permissions      model as described in [Section 9.1. Permission](#9_1_permissions.md). *    [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep the content capturing service      components separate, for example, not binding the service or sharing process      IDs, from other system components except for the following:       *    Telephony, Contacts, System UI, and Media  ### 9.8.7\. Clipboard Access  Device implementations:    * [C-0-1] MUST NOT return a clipped data on the clipboard (e.g. via the     [`ClipboardManager`](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager)     API) unless the app is the default IME or is the app that currently has     focus.  ### 9.8.8\. Location  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST NOT turn on/off device location setting and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanning settings without explicit user consent or user initiation. *   [C-0-2] MUST provide the user affordance to access location related information including recent location requests, app level permissions and usage of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanning for determining location. *   [C-0-3] MUST ensure that the application using Emergency Location Bypass API [LocationRequest.setLocationSettingsIgnored()] is a user initiated emergency session (e.g. dial 911 or text to 911). For Automotive however, a vehicle MAY initiate an emergency session without active user interaction in the case a crash/accident is detected (e.g. to satisfy eCall requirements). *   [C-0-4] MUST preserve the Emergency Location Bypass API's ability to bypass device location settings without changing the settings. *   [C-0-5] MUST schedule a notification that reminds the user after an app in the background has accessed their location using the [`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`] permission.  ### 9.8.9\. Installed apps  Android apps targeting API level 30 or above cannot see details about other installed apps by default (see [Package visibility]( https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/package-visibility) in the Android SDK documentation).  Device implementations:  *   [C-0-1] MUST NOT expose to any app targeting API level 30 or above details     about any other installed app, unless the app is already able to see details     about the other installed app through the managed APIs. This includes but is     not limited to details exposed by any custom APIs added by the device     implementer, or accessible via the filesystem.  ### 9.8.10\. Connectivity Bug Report  If device implementations generate bug reports using System API `BUGREPORT_MODE_TELEPHONY` with BugreportManager, they:  *   [C-1-1] MUST obtain user consent every time the System API     `BUGREPORT_MODE_TELEPHONY` is called to generate a report and MUST NOT     prompt the user to consent to all future requests from the application. *   [C-1-2] MUST display and obtain explicit user consent when the reports are     starting to be generated and MUST NOT return the generated report     to the requesting app without explicit user consent. *   [C-1-3] MUST generate requested reports containing at least the following     information:     *   TelephonyDebugService dump     *   TelephonyRegistry dump     *   WifiService dump     *   ConnectivityService dump     *   A dump of the calling package's CarrierService instance (if bound)     *   Radio log buffer *   [C-1-4] MUST NOT include the following in the generated reports:     *   Any kind of information unrelated to connectivity debugging.     *   Any kind of user-installed application traffic logs or detailed profiles         of user-installed applications/packages (UIDs are okay, package names         are not). *   MAY include additional information that is not associated with any user     identity. (e.g. vendor logs).  If device implementations include additional information (e.g vendor logs) in the bug report and that information has privacy/security/battery/storage/memory impact, they:  *   [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have a developer setting defaulted to     disabled. The AOSP meets this by providing the     `Enable verbose vendor logging` option in developer settings to include     additional device-specific vendor logs in the bug reports.  ### 9.8.11\. Data blobs sharing  Android, through [BlobStoreManager]( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/blob/BlobStoreManager) allows apps to contribute data blobs to the System to be shared with a selected set of apps.  If device implementations support shared data blobs as described in the [SDK documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/blob/BlobStoreManager), they:    * [C-1-1] MUST NOT share data blobs belonging to apps beyond what they     intended to allow (i.e. the scope of default access and the other access     modes that can be specified using     [BlobStoreManager.session#allowPackageAccess()](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/blob/BlobStoreManager.Session#allowPackageAccess%28java.lang.String%2C%2520byte%5B%5D%29),     [BlobStoreManager.session#allowSameSignatureAccess()](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/blob/BlobStoreManager.Session#allowSameSignatureAccess%28%29),     or [BlobStoreManager.session#allowPublicAccess()](     https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/blob/BlobStoreManager.Session#allowPublicAccess%28%29)     MUST NOT be modified). The AOSP reference implementation meets these     requirements.   * [C-1-2] MUST NOT send off device or share with other apps the secure hashes     of data blobs (which are used to control access)."""

"9_11_keys-and-credentials"	"9.11"	""	"09110000.48"	"9.11"	"""## 9.11\. Keys and Credentials  The [Android Keystore System](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html) allows app developers to store cryptographic keys in a container and use them in cryptographic operations through the [KeyChain API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyChain.html) or the [Keystore API](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore.html). Device implementations:  *    [C-0-1] MUST allow at least 8,192 keys to be imported or generated. *    [C-0-2] The lock screen authentication MUST rate-limit attempts and MUST have an exponential backoff algorithm. Beyond 150 failed attempts, the delay MUST be at least 24 hours per attempt. *    SHOULD not limit the number of keys that can be generated  When the device implementation supports a secure lock screen, it:  *    [C-1-1] MUST back up the keystore implementation with an isolated      execution environment. *    [C-1-2] MUST have implementations of RSA, AES, ECDSA and HMAC cryptographic algorithms and MD5, SHA1, and SHA-2 family hash functions to properly support the Android Keystore system's supported algorithms in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the isolated environment, including DMA. The upstream Android Open Source Project (AOSP) meets this requirement by using the [Trusty](https://source.android.com/security/trusty/) implementation, but another ARM TrustZone-based solution or a third-party reviewed secure implementation of a proper hypervisor-based isolation are alternative options. *    [C-1-3] MUST perform the lock screen authentication in the isolated execution environment and only when successful, allow the authentication-bound keys to be used. Lock screen credentials MUST be stored in a way that allows only the isolated execution environment to perform lock screen authentication. The upstream Android Open Source Project provides the [Gatekeeper Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)](http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/authentication/gatekeeper.html) and Trusty, which can be used to satisfy this requirement. *    [C-1-4] MUST support key attestation where the attestation signing key is protected by secure hardware and signing is performed in secure hardware. The attestation signing keys MUST be shared across large enough number of devices to prevent the keys from being used as device identifiers. One way of meeting this requirement is to share the same attestation key unless at least 100,000 units of a given SKU are produced. If more than 100,000 units of an SKU are produced, a different key MAY be used for each 100,000 units.  Note that if a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version, such a device is exempted from the requirement to have a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment and support the key attestation, unless it declares the `android.hardware.fingerprint` feature which requires a keystore backed by an isolated execution environment.  *    [C-1-5] MUST allow the user to choose the Sleep timeout for transition from      the unlocked to the locked state, with a minimum allowable timeout up to      15 seconds. Automotive devices, that lock the screen whenever the head unit      is turned off or the user is switched, MAY NOT have the Sleep timeout      configuration.  ### 9.11.1\. Secure Lock Screen and Authentication  The AOSP implementation follows a tiered authentication model where a knowledge-factory based primary authentication can be backed by either a secondary strong biometric, or by weaker tertiary modalities.  Device implementations:  *    [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to set only one of the following as the primary authentication method:      *     A numerical PIN      *     An alphanumerical password      *     A swipe pattern on a grid of exactly 3x3 dots  Note that the above authentication methods are referred as the recommended primary authentication methods in this document.  If device implementations add or modify the recommended primary authentication methods and use a new authentication method as a secure way to lock the screen, the new authentication method:  *    [C-2-1] MUST be the user authentication method as described in      [Requiring User Authentication For Key Use](      https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html#UserAuthentication).  If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen if based on a known secret and use a new authentication method to be treated as a secure way to lock the screen:  *    [C-3-1] The entropy of the shortest allowed length of inputs MUST be      greater than 10 bits. *    [C-3-2] The maximum entropy of all possible inputs MUST be greater than      18 bits. *    [C-3-3] The new authentication method MUST NOT replace any of the      recommended primary authentication methods (i.e. PIN, pattern, password)      implemented and provided in AOSP. *    [C-3-4] The new authentication method MUST be disabled when the Device      Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the password quality policy      via the      [`DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality()`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setPasswordQuality%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      method with a more restrictive quality constant than     `PASSWORD_QUALITY_SOMETHING`. *    [C-3-5] New authentication methods MUST either fall back to the      recommended primary authentication methods (i.e. PIN, pattern,      password) once every 72 hours or less OR clearly disclose to the      user that some data will not be backed up in order to preserve      the privacy of their data.  If device implementations add or modify the recommended primary authentication methods to unlock the lock screen and use a new authentication method that is based on biometrics to be treated as a secure way to lock the screen, the new method:  *    [C-4-1] MUST meet all requirements described in [section      7.3.10](#7_3_10_biometric_sensors) for **Class 1** (formerly      **Convenience**). *    [C-4-2] MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended      primary authentication methods which is based on a known secret. *    [C-4-3] MUST be disabled and only allow the recommended primary      authentication to unlock the screen when the Device Policy Controller (DPC)      application has set the keyguard feature policy by calling the method      [`DevicePolicyManager.setKeyguardDisabledFeatures()`](      http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setKeyguardDisabledFeatures%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      , with any of the associated biometric flags (i.e.      `KEYGUARD_DISABLE_BIOMETRICS`, `KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FINGERPRINT`,      `KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FACE`, or `KEYGUARD_DISABLE_IRIS`).  If the biometric authentication methods do not meet the requirements for **Class 3** (formerly **Strong**) as described in [section 7.3.10](#7_3_10_biometric_sensors):  *    [C-5-1] The methods MUST be disabled if the Device Policy Controller (DPC)      application has set the password quality policy via the [`DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality()`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html\#setPasswordQuality%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      method with a more restrictive quality constant than      `PASSWORD_QUALITY_BIOMETRIC_WEAK`. *    [C-5-2] The user MUST be challenged for the recommended primary      authentication (eg: PIN, pattern, password) as described in [C-1-7] and      [C-1-8] in [section 7.3.10](#7_3_10_biometric_sensors). *    [C-5-3] The methods MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen, and MUST      meet the requirements that start with C-8 in this section below.  If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen and a new authentication method is based on a physical token or the location:  *    [C-6-1] They MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended      primary authentication methods which is based on a known secret and meet      the requirements to be treated as a secure lock screen. *    [C-6-2] The new method MUST be disabled and only allow one of the      recommended primary authentication methods to unlock the screen when the      Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the policy with either      the      [`DevicePolicyManager.setKeyguardDisabledFeatures(KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS)`](      http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setKeyguardDisabledFeatures%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      method or the      [`DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality()`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setPasswordQuality%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      method with a more restrictive quality constant than      `PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED`. *    [C-6-3] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary      authentication methods (e.g.PIN, pattern, password) at least once every 4      hours or less. *    [C-6-4] The new method MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen and MUST      follow the constraints listed in C-8 below.  If device implementations have a secure lock screen and include one or more trust agent, which implements the `TrustAgentService` System API, they:  *    [C-7-1] MUST have clear indication in the settings menu and on the lock      screen when device lock is deferred or can be unlocked by trust agent(s).      For example, AOSP meets this requirement by showing a text description for      the ""Automatically lock setting"" and ""Power button instantly locks"" in the      settings menu and a distinguishable icon on the lock screen. *    [C-7-2] MUST respect and fully implement all trust agent APIs in the      `DevicePolicyManager` class, such as the      [`KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#KEYGUARD&lowbarDISABLE&lowbarTRUST&lowbarAGENTS)      constant. *    [C-7-3] MUST NOT fully implement the `TrustAgentService.addEscrowToken()`      function on a device that is used as a primary personal device      (e.g. handheld) but MAY fully implement the function on device      implementations that are typically shared (e.g. Android Television or      Automotive device). *    [C-7-4] MUST encrypt all stored tokens added by      `TrustAgentService.addEscrowToken()`. *    [C-7-5] MUST NOT store the encryption key or escrow token on the      same device where the key is used. For example, it is allowed for      a key stored on a phone to unlock a user account on a TV.      For Automotive devices, it is not allowed for the escrow token to be stored      on any part of the vehicle. *    [C-7-6] MUST inform the user about the security implications before      enabling the escrow token to decrypt the data storage. *    [C-7-7] MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended      primary authentication methods. *    [C-7-8] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary      authentication (eg: PIN, pattern, password) methods at least once every 72      hours or less. *    [C-7-9] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary      authentication (eg: PIN, pattern, password) methods as described in      [C-1-7] and [C-1-8] in [section 7.3.10](#7_3_10_biometric_sensors). *    [C-7-10] MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen and MUST follow the      constraints listed in C-8 below. *    [C-7-11] MUST NOT allow TrustAgents on primary personal devices      (e.g: handheld) to unlock the device, and can only use them to      keep an already unlocked device in the unlocked state for up to a      maximum of 4 hours. The default implementation of      TrustManagerService in AOSP meets this requirement. *    [C-7-12] MUST use a cryptographically secure (e.g UKEY2)      communication channel to pass the escrow token from the storage      device to the target device.  If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen that is not a secure lock screen as described above, and use a new authentication method to unlock the keyguard:  *    [C-8-1] The new method MUST be disabled when the Device Policy Controller      (DPC) application has set the password quality policy via the      [`DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality()`](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setPasswordQuality%28android.content.ComponentName,%20int%29)      method with a more restrictive quality constant than      `PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED`. *    [C-8-2] They MUST NOT reset the password expiration timers set by      [`DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordExpirationTimeout()`](      http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html#setPasswordExpirationTimeout%28android.content.ComponentName,%20long%29). *    [C-8-3] They MUST NOT expose an API for use by third-party apps to      determine the lock state.  ### 9.11.2\. StrongBox  The [Android Keystore System]( https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html) allows app developers to store cryptographic keys in a dedicated secure processor as well as the isolated execution environment described above.  Such a dedicated secure processor is called ""StrongBox"".  Requirements C-1-3 through C-1-11 below define the requirements a device must meet to qualify as a StrongBox.  Device implementations that have a dedicated secure processor:  *    [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support StrongBox. StrongBox will      likely become a requirement in a future release.  If device implementations support StrongBox, they:  *    [C-1-1] MUST declare [FEATURE_STRONGBOX_KEYSTORE]( https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/pm/PackageManager#FEATURE_STRONGBOX_KEYSTORE%3Akotlin.String).  *    [C-1-2] MUST provide dedicated secure hardware that is used to back keystore and secure user authentication.  The dedicated secure hardware may be used for other purposes as well.  *    [C-1-3] MUST have a discrete CPU that shares no cache, DRAM, coprocessors or other core resources with the application processor (AP).  *    [C-1-4] MUST ensure that any peripherals shared with the AP cannot alter StrongBox processing in any way, or obtain any information from the StrongBox. The AP MAY disable or block access to StrongBox.  *    [C-1-5] MUST have an internal clock with reasonable accuracy (+-10%) that is immune to manipulation by the AP.  *    [C-1-6] MUST have a true random number generator that produces uniformly-distributed and unpredictable output.  *    [C-1-7] MUST have tamper resistance, including resistance against physical penetration, and glitching.  *    [C-1-8] MUST have side-channel resistance, including resistance against leaking information via power, timing, electromagnetic radiation, and thermal radiation side channels.  *    [C-1-9] MUST have secure storage which ensures confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, consistency, and freshness of the contents. The storage MUST NOT be able to be read or altered, except as permitted by the StrongBox APIs.  *    To validate compliance with [C-1-3] through [C-1-9], device      implementations:      *    [C-1-10] MUST include the hardware that is certified against the          Secure IC Protection Profile [BSI-CC-PP-0084-2014](          https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/pp0084b_pdf.pdf) or          evaluated by a nationally accredited testing laboratory incorporating          High attack potential vulnerability assessment according to the          [Common Criteria Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards](        https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/supdocs/CCDB-2013-05-002.pdf).     *    [C-1-11] MUST include the firmware that is evaluated by a          nationally accredited testing laboratory incorporating High attack          potential vulnerability assessment according to the          [Common Criteria Application of Attack Potential to Smartcards](          https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/supdocs/CCDB-2013-05-002.pdf).     *    [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to include the hardware that is          evaluated using a Security Target, Evaluation Assurance Level          (EAL) 5, augmented by AVA_VAN.5.  EAL 5 certification will likely          become a requirement in a future release.  *    [C-SR] are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to provide insider attack resistance (IAR), which means that an insider with access to firmware signing keys cannot produce firmware that causes the StrongBox to leak secrets, to bypass functional security requirements or otherwise enable access to sensitive user data. The recommended way to implement IAR is to allow firmware updates only when the primary user password is provided via the IAuthSecret HAL. IAR will likely become a requirement in a future release.  ### 9.11.3\. Identity Credential  The Identity Credential System is defined and achieved by implementing all APIs in the [`android.security.identity.*`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/identity/package-summary) package. These APIs allows app developers to store and retrieve user identity documents. Device implementations:  *    [C-SR] are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to implement the Identity Credential System.  If device implementations implement the Identity Credential System, they:  *    [C-0-1] MUST return non-null for the [IdentityCredentialStore#getInstance()](      https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/identity/IdentityCredentialStore#getInstance%28android.content.Context%29)      method.  *    [C-0-2] MUST implement the Identity Credential System (e.g. the      `android.security.identity.*` APIs) with code communicating with a trusted      application in an area that is securely isolated from the code running on      the kernel and above. Secure isolation MUST block all potential mechanisms      by which kernel or userspace code might access the internal state of the      isolated environment, including DMA.  *    [C-0-3] The cryptographic operations needed to implement the Identity      Credential System (e.g. the `android.security.identity.*` APIs) MUST be      performed entirely in the trusted application and private key material MUST      never leave the isolated execution environment unless specifically required      by higher-level APIs (e.g. the      [createEphemeralKeyPair()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/identity/IdentityCredential#createEphemeralKeyPair%28%29)      method).  *    [C-0-4] The trusted application MUST be implemented in a way such that its      security properties  are not affected (e.g. credential data is not released unless access      control conditions are satisfied, MACs can't be produced for arbitrary      data) even if Android is misbehaving or compromised.
