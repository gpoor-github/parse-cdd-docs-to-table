,1,,1,"""01000000.00000""",,,,,,,,"""""1_introduction""> This document enumerates the requirements that must be met in order for devices to be compatible with Android 11. The use of “MUST”; “MUST NOT”; “REQUIRED”; “SHALL”; “SHALL NOT”; “SHOULD”; “SHOULD NOT”; “RECOMMENDED”; “MAY”; and “OPTIONAL” is per the IETF standard defined in RFC2119. As used in this document; a “device implementer” or “implementer” is a person or organization developing a hardware/software solution running Android 11. A “device implementation” or “implementation"" is the hardware/software solution so developed. To be considered compatible with Android 11; device implementations MUST meet the requirements presented in this Compatibility Definition; including any documents incorporated via reference. Where this definition or the software tests described in section 10 is silent; ambiguous; or incomplete; it is the responsibility of the device implementer to ensure compatibility with existing implementations. For this reason; the Android Open Source Project is both the reference and preferred implementation of Android. Device implementers are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to base their implementations to the greatest extent possible on the “upstream” source code available from the Android Open Source Project. While some components can hypothetically be replaced with alternate implementations; it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not follow this practice; as passing the software tests will become substantially more difficult. It is the implementer’s responsibility to ensure full behavioral compatibility with the standard Android implementation; including and beyond the Compatibility Test Suite. Finally; note that certain component substitutions and modifications are explicitly forbidden by this document. Many of the resources linked to in this document are derived directly or indirectly from the Android SDK and will be functionally identical to the information in that SDK’s documentation. In any cases where this Compatibility Definition or the Compatibility Test Suite disagrees with the SDK documentation; the SDK documentation is considered authoritative. Any technical details provided in the linked resources throughout this document are considered by inclusion to be part of this Compatibility Definition. <h3 id="""

MAY only manage the visibility and timing of when third-party apps can notify users of notable events to mitigate safety issues such as driver distraction. Android 11 introduces support for conversation notifications; which are notifications that use MessagingStyle and provides a published People Shortcut ID.

The AOSP implementation meets these requirements with the default System UI; Settings; and Launcher.

SHOULD present each and every resource element (e.g. icon; title and summary text) defined in the Notification.Style API class and its subclasses.

This should be tested using the Android app version of SynthMark commit id 09b13c6f49ea089f8c31e5d035f912cc405b7ab8. SynthMark uses a software synthesizer running on a simulated audio framework that measures system performance. The SynthMark app needs to be run using the “Automated Test” option and achieve the following results: voicemark.90 &gt;= 32 voices latencymark.fixed.little &lt;= 15 msec latencymark.dynamic.little &lt;= 50 msec See the SynthMark documentation for an explanation of the benchmarks. SHOULD minimize audio clock inaccuracy and drift relative to standard time. SHOULD minimize audio clock drift relative to the CPU CLOCK_MONOTONIC when both are active. SHOULD minimize audio latency over on-device transducers. SHOULD minimize audio latency over USB digital audio. SHOULD document audio latency measurements over all paths. SHOULD minimize jitter in audio buffer completion callback entry times; as this affects usable percentage of full CPU bandwidth by the callback. SHOULD provide zero audio glitches under normal use at reported latency. SHOULD provide zero inter-channel latency difference. SHOULD minimize MIDI mean latency over all transports. SHOULD minimize MIDI latency variability under load (jitter) over all transports. SHOULD provide accurate MIDI timestamps over all transports. SHOULD minimize audio signal noise over on-device transducers; including the period immediately after cold start. SHOULD provide zero audio clock difference between the input and output sides of corresponding end-points; when both are active. Examples of corresponding end-points include the on-device microphone and speaker; or the audio jack input and output. SHOULD handle audio buffer completion callbacks for the input and output sides of corresponding end-points on the same thread when both are active; and enter the output callback immediately after the return from the input callback. Or if it is not feasible to handle the callbacks on the same thread; then enter the output callback shortly after entering the input callback to permit the application to have a consistent timing of the input and output sides. SHOULD minimize the phase difference between HAL audio buffering for the input and output sides of corresponding end-points. SHOULD minimize touch latency. SHOULD minimize touch latency variability under load (jitter). SHOULD have a latency from touch input to audio output of less than or equal to 40 ms. If device implementations meet all of the above requirements; they: [SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to report support for feature android.hardware.audio.pro via the android.content.pm.PackageManager class. If device implementations include a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack; they: [C-2-1] MUST have the continuous round-trip audio latency to be 20 milliseconds or less over the audio jack path. [SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to comply with section Mobile device (jack) specifications of the Wired Audio Headset Specification (v1.1). The continuous round-trip audio latency SHOULD be 10 milliseconds or less over the audio jack path. If device implementations omit a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack and include a USB port(s) supporting USB host mode; they: [C-3-1] MUST implement the USB audio class. [C-3-2] MUST have a continuous round-trip audio latency of 20 milliseconds or less over the USB host mode port using USB audio class. The continuous round-trip audio latency SHOULD be 10 milliseconds or less over the USB host mode port using USB audio class. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support simultaneous I/O up to 8 channels each direction; 96 kHz sample rate; and 24-bit or 32-bit depth; when used with USB audio peripherals that also support these requirements. If device implementations include an HDMI port; they: SHOULD support output in stereo and eight channels at 20-bit or 24-bit depth and 192 kHz without bit-depth loss or resampling; in at least one configuration. <h3 id="""

Fake Touch Input Fake touch interface provides a user input system that approximates a subset of touchscreen capabilities. For example; a mouse or remote control that drives an on-screen cursor approximates touch; but requires the user to first point or focus then click. Numerous input devices like the mouse; trackpad; gyro-based air mouse; gyro-pointer; joystick; and multi-touch trackpad can support fake touch interactions. Android includes the feature constant android.hardware.faketouch; which corresponds to a high-fidelity non-touch (pointer-based) input device such as a mouse or trackpad that can adequately emulate touch-based input (including basic gesture support); and indicates that the device supports an emulated subset of touchscreen functionality.

Some sensor types are composite; meaning they can be derived from data provided by one or more other sensors. (Examples include the orientation sensor and the linear acceleration sensor.) Device implementations: SHOULD implement these sensor types; when they include the prerequisite physical sensors as described in sensor types. If device implementations include a composite sensor; they: [C-2-1] MUST implement the sensor as described in the Android Open Source documentation on composite sensors.

For example; this means that the confirm action based on a physical button is routed through an input-only general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pin of a secure element (SE) that cannot be driven by any other means than a physical button press. [C-5-2] MUST additionally implement an implicit authentication flow (without confirmation step) corresponding to setConfirmationRequired(boolean); which applications can set to utilize for sign-in flows. If device implementations have multiple biometric sensors; they: [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to require only one biometric be confirmed per authentication (e.g. if both fingerprint and face sensors are available on the device; onAuthenticationSucceeded should be sent after any one of them is confirmed). In order for device implementations to allow access to keystore keys to third-party applications; they: [C-6-1] MUST meet the requirements for Class 3 as defined in this section below. [C-6-2] MUST present only Class 3 biometrics when the authentication requires BIOMETRIC_STRONG; or the authentication is invoked with a CryptoObject. If device implementations wish to treat a biometric sensor as Class 1 (formerly Convenience); they: [C-1-1] MUST have a false acceptance rate less than 0.002%. [C-1-2] MUST disclose that this mode may be less secure than a strong PIN; pattern; or password and clearly enumerate the risks of enabling it; if the spoof and imposter acceptance rates are higher than 7% as measured by the Android Biometrics Test Protocols. [C-1-3] MUST rate limit attempts for at least 30 seconds after five false trials for biometric verification - where a false trial is one with an adequate capture quality (BIOMETRIC_ACQUIRED_GOOD) that does not match an enrolled biometric. [C-1-4] MUST prevent adding new biometrics without first establishing a chain of trust by having the user confirm existing or add a new device credential (PIN/pattern/password) that's secured by TEE; the Android Open Source Project implementation provides the mechanism in the framework to do so. [C-1-5] MUST completely remove all identifiable biometric data for a user when the user's account is removed (including via a factory reset). [C-1-6] MUST honor the individual flag for that biometric (i.e. DevicePolicyManager.KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FINGERPRINT; DevicePolicymanager.KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FACE ; or DevicePolicymanager.KEYGUARD_DISABLE_IRIS ). [C-1-7] MUST challenge the user for the recommended primary authentication (e.g. PIN; pattern; password) once every 24 hours or less for new devices launching with Android version 10; once every 72 hours or less for devices upgrading from earlier Android version. [C-1-8] MUST challenge the user for the recommended primary authentication (eg: PIN; pattern; password) after one of the following: a 4-hour idle timeout period; OR 3 failed biometric authentication attempts. The idle timeout period and the failed authentication count is reset after any successful confirmation of the device credentials. Upgrading devices from an earlier Android version can be exempted from C-1-8. * [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use the logic in the framework provided by the Android Open Source Project to enforce constraints specified in [C-1-7] and [C-1-8] for new devices. * [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have a false rejection rate of less than 10%; as measured on the device. * [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have a latency below 1 second; measured from when the biometric is detected; until the screen is unlocked; for each enrolled biometric. If device implementations wish to treat a biometric sensor as Class 2 (formerly Weak); they: [C-2-1] MUST meet all requirements for Class 1 above. [C-2-2] MUST have a spoof and imposter acceptance rate not higher than 20% as measured by the Android Biometrics Test Protocols. [C-2-3] MUST perform the biometric matching in an isolated execution environment outside Android user or kernel space; such as the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE); or on a chip with a secure channel to the isolated execution environment. [C-2-4] MUST have all identifiable data encrypted and cryptographically authenticated such that they cannot be acquired; read or altered outside of the isolated execution environment or a chip with a secure channel to the isolated execution environment as documented in the implementation guidelines on the Android Open Source Project site. [C-2-5] For camera based biometrics; while biometric based authentication or enrollment is happening: MUST operate the camera in a mode that prevents camera frames from being read or altered outside the isolated execution environment or a chip with a secure channel to the isolated execution environment. For RGB single-camera solutions; the camera frames CAN be readable outside the isolated execution environment to support operations such as preview for enrollment; but MUST still NOT be alterable. [C-2-6] MUST NOT enable third-party applications to distinguish between individual biometric enrollments. [C-2-7] MUST NOT allow unencrypted access to identifiable biometric data or any data derived from it (such as embeddings) to the Application Processor outside the context of the TEE. [C-2-8] MUST have a secure processing pipeline such that an operating system or kernel compromise cannot allow data to be directly injected to falsely authenticate as the user. If device implementations are already launched on an earlier Android version and cannot meet the requirement C-2-8 through a system software update; they MAY be exempted from the requirement. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to include liveness detection for all biometric modalities and attention detection for Face biometrics. If device implementations wish to treat a biometric sensor as Class 3 (formerly Strong); they: [C-3-1] MUST meet all the requirements of Class 2 above; except for [C-1-7] and [C-1-8]. Upgrading devices from an earlier Android version are not exempted from C-2-7. [C-3-2] MUST have a hardware-backed keystore implementation. [C-3-3] MUST have a spoof and imposter acceptance rate not higher than 7% as measured by the Android Biometrics Test Protocols. [C-3-4] MUST challenge the user for the recommended primary authentication (e.g. PIN; pattern; password) once every 72 hours or less. <h4 id="""

For example; with equivalent settings; autofocus speed and accuracy must be identical; and the quality of captured images must be the same. Features that depend on the different semantics of the two APIs are not required to have matching speed or quality; but SHOULD match as closely as possible. Device implementations MUST implement the following behaviors for the camera-related APIs; for all available cameras. Device implementations: [C-0-1] MUST use android.hardware.PixelFormat.YCbCr_420_SP for preview data provided to application callbacks when an application has never called android.hardware.Camera.Parameters.setPreviewFormat(int). [C-0-2] MUST further be in the NV21 encoding format when an application registers an android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback instance and the system calls the onPreviewFrame() method and the preview format is YCbCr_420_SP; the data in the byte[] passed into onPreviewFrame(). That is; NV21 MUST be the default. [C-0-3] MUST support the YV12 format (as denoted by the android.graphics.ImageFormat.YV12 constant) for camera previews for both front- and rear-facing cameras for android.hardware.Camera. (The hardware video encoder and camera may use any native pixel format; but the device implementation MUST support conversion to YV12.) [C-0-4] MUST support the android.hardware.ImageFormat.YUV_420_888 and android.hardware.ImageFormat.JPEG formats as outputs through the android.media.ImageReader API for android.hardware.camera2 devices that advertise REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE capability in android.request.availableCapabilities. [C-0-5] MUST still implement the full Camera API included in the Android SDK documentation; regardless of whether the device includes hardware autofocus or other capabilities. For instance; cameras that lack autofocus MUST still call any registered android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback instances (even though this has no relevance to a non-autofocus camera.) Note that this does apply to front-facing cameras; for instance; even though most front-facing cameras do not support autofocus; the API callbacks must still be “faked” as described. [C-0-6] MUST recognize and honor each parameter name defined as a constant in the android.hardware.Camera.Parameters class and the android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest class. Conversely; device implementations MUST NOT honor or recognize string constants passed to the android.hardware.Camera.setParameters() method other than those documented as constants on the android.hardware.Camera.Parameters. That is; device implementations MUST support all standard Camera parameters if the hardware allows; and MUST NOT support custom Camera parameter types. For instance; device implementations that support image capture using high dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques MUST support camera parameter Camera.SCENE_MODE_HDR. [C-0-7] MUST report the proper level of support with the android.info.supportedHardwareLevel property as described in the Android SDK and report the appropriate framework feature flags. [C-0-8] MUST also declare its individual camera capabilities of android.hardware.camera2 via the android.request.availableCapabilities property and declare the appropriate feature flags; MUST define the feature flag if any of its attached camera devices supports the feature. [C-0-9] MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE intent whenever a new picture is taken by the camera and the entry of the picture has been added to the media store. [C-0-10] MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO intent whenever a new video is recorded by the camera and the entry of the picture has been added to the media store. [C-0-11] MUST have all cameras accessible via the deprecated android.hardware.Camera API also accessible via the android.hardware.camera2 API. [C-0-12] MUST ensure that the facial appearance is NOT altered; including but not limited to altering facial geometry; facial skin tone; or facial skin smoothening for any android.hardware.camera2 or android.hardware.Camera API. [C-SR] For devices with multiple RGB cameras facing in the same direction; are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support a logical camera device that lists capability CameraMetadata.REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA; consisting of all of the RGB cameras facing that direction as physical sub-devices. If device implementations provide a proprietary camera API to 3rd-party apps; they: [C-1-1] MUST implement such a camera API using android.hardware.camera2 API. MAY provide vendor tags and/or extensions to android.hardware.camera2 API. <h4 id="""

Security Features Device implementations MUST ensure compliance with security features in both the kernel and platform as described below. The Android Sandbox includes features that use the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) mandatory access control (MAC) system; seccomp sandboxing; and other security features in the Linux kernel. Device implementations: [C-0-1] MUST maintain compatibility with existing applications; even when SELinux or any other security features are implemented below the Android framework. [C-0-2] MUST NOT have a visible user interface when a security violation is detected and successfully blocked by the security feature implemented below the Android framework; but MAY have a visible user interface when an unblocked security violation occurs resulting in a successful exploit. [C-0-3] MUST NOT make SELinux or any other security features implemented below the Android framework configurable to the user or app developer. [C-0-4] MUST NOT allow an application that can affect another application through an API (such as a Device Administration API) to configure a policy that breaks compatibility. [C-0-5] MUST split the media framework into multiple processes so that it is possible to more narrowly grant access for each process as described in the Android Open Source Project site. [C-0-6] MUST implement a kernel application sandboxing mechanism which allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy from multithreaded programs. The upstream Android Open Source Project meets this requirement through enabling the seccomp-BPF with threadgroup synchronization (TSYNC) as described in the Kernel Configuration section of source.android.com. Kernel integrity and self-protection features are integral to Android security. Device implementations: [C-0-7] MUST implement kernel stack buffer overflow protection mechanisms. Examples of such mechanisms are CC_STACKPROTECTOR_REGULAR and CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG. [C-0-8] MUST implement strict kernel memory protections where executable code is read-only; read-only data is non-executable and non-writable; and writable data is non-executable (e.g. CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA or CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX). [C-0-9] MUST implement static and dynamic object size bounds checking of copies between user-space and kernel-space (e.g. CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. [C-0-10] MUST NOT execute user-space memory when executing in the kernel mode (e.g. hardware PXN; or emulated via CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN or CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. [C-0-11] MUST NOT read or write user-space memory in the kernel outside of normal usercopy access APIs (e.g. hardware PAN; or emulated via CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN or CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN) on devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher. [C-0-12] MUST implement kernel page table isolation if the hardware is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5754 on all devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher (e.g. CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION or CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0). [C-0-13] MUST implement branch prediction hardening if the hardware is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 on all devices originally shipping with API level 28 or higher (e.g. CONFIG_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR). [SR] STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep kernel data which is written only during initialization marked read-only after initialization (e.g. __ro_after_init). [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to randomize the layout of the kernel code and memory; and to avoid exposures that would compromise the randomization (e.g. CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE with bootloader entropy via the /chosen/kaslr-seed Device Tree node or EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL). [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable control flow integrity (CFI) in the kernel to provide additional protection against code-reuse attacks (e.g. CONFIG_CFI_CLANG and CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK). [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED not to disable Control-Flow Integrity (CFI); Shadow Call Stack (SCS) or Integer Overflow Sanitization (IntSan) on components that have it enabled. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable CFI; SCS; and IntSan for any additional security-sensitive userspace components as explained in CFI and IntSan. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable stack initialization in the kernel to prevent uses of uninitialized local variables (CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL or CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO). Also; device implementations SHOULD NOT assume the value used by the compiler to initialize the locals. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to enable heap initialization in the kernel to prevent uses of uninitialized heap allocations (CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON) and they SHOULD NOT assume the value used by the kernel to initialize those allocations. If device implementations use a Linux kernel; they: [C-1-1] MUST implement SELinux. [C-1-2] MUST set SELinux to global enforcing mode. [C-1-3] MUST configure all domains in enforcing mode. No permissive mode domains are allowed; including domains specific to a device/vendor. [C-1-4] MUST NOT modify; omit; or replace the neverallow rules present within the system/sepolicy folder provided in the upstream Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the policy MUST compile with all neverallow rules present; for both AOSP SELinux domains as well as device/vendor specific domains. [C-1-5] MUST run third-party applications targeting API level 28 or higher in per-application SELinux sandboxes with per-app SELinux restrictions on each application's private data directory. SHOULD retain the default SELinux policy provided in the system/sepolicy folder of the upstream Android Open Source Project and only further add to this policy for their own device-specific configuration. If device implementations use kernel other than Linux; they: [C-2-1] MUST use a mandatory access control system that is equivalent to SELinux.

The FLASH_LOCK_UNKNOWN state is reserved for device implementations upgrading from an earlier version of Android where this new system API method did not exist. [C-0-2] MUST support Verified Boot for device integrity. If device implementations are already launched without supporting Verified Boot on an earlier version of Android and can not add support for this feature with a system software update; they MAY be exempted from the requirement.

If device implementations support the feature; they: [C-1-1] MUST declare the platform feature flag android.software.verified_boot. [C-1-2] MUST perform verification on every boot sequence. [C-1-3] MUST start verification from an immutable hardware key that is the root of trust and go all the way up to the system partition. [C-1-4] MUST implement each stage of verification to check the integrity and authenticity of all the bytes in the next stage before executing the code in the next stage. [C-1-5] MUST use verification algorithms as strong as current recommendations from NIST for hashing algorithms (SHA-256) and public key sizes (RSA-2048). [C-1-6] MUST NOT allow boot to complete when system verification fails; unless the user consents to attempt booting anyway; in which case the data from any non-verified storage blocks MUST not be used. [C-1-7] MUST NOT allow verified partitions on the device to be modified unless the user has explicitly unlocked the bootloader. [C-SR] If there are multiple discrete chips in the device (e.g. radio; specialized image processor); the boot process of each of those chips is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to verify every stage upon booting. [C-1-8] MUST use tamper-evident storage: for storing whether the bootloader is unlocked. Tamper-evident storage means that the bootloader can detect if the storage has been tampered with from inside Android. [C-1-9] MUST prompt the user; while using the device; and require physical confirmation before allowing a transition from bootloader locked mode to bootloader unlocked mode. [C-1-10] MUST implement rollback protection for partitions used by Android (e.g. boot; system partitions) and use tamper-evident storage for storing the metadata used for determining the minimum allowable OS version. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to verify all privileged app APK files with a chain of trust rooted in partitions protected by Verified Boot. [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to verify any executable artifacts loaded by a privileged app from outside its APK file (such as dynamically loaded code or compiled code) before executing them or STRONGLY RECOMMENDED not to execute them at all.

[C-0-4] MUST NOT allow the read requests on a protected file to succeed when the read content do not verify against a trusted key.

Secure Lock Screen and Authentication The AOSP implementation follows a tiered authentication model where a knowledge-factory based primary authentication can be backed by either a secondary strong biometric; or by weaker tertiary modalities. Device implementations: [C-SR] Are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to set only one of the following as the primary authentication method: A numerical PIN An alphanumerical password A swipe pattern on a grid of exactly 3x3 dots Note that the above authentication methods are referred as the recommended primary authentication methods in this document. If device implementations add or modify the recommended primary authentication methods and use a new authentication method as a secure way to lock the screen; the new authentication method: [C-2-1] MUST be the user authentication method as described in Requiring User Authentication For Key Use. If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen if based on a known secret and use a new authentication method to be treated as a secure way to lock the screen: [C-3-1] The entropy of the shortest allowed length of inputs MUST be greater than 10 bits. [C-3-2] The maximum entropy of all possible inputs MUST be greater than 18 bits. [C-3-3] The new authentication method MUST NOT replace any of the recommended primary authentication methods (i.e. PIN; pattern; password) implemented and provided in AOSP. [C-3-4] The new authentication method MUST be disabled when the Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the password quality policy via the DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality() method with a more restrictive quality constant than PASSWORD_QUALITY_SOMETHING. [C-3-5] New authentication methods MUST either fall back to the recommended primary authentication methods (i.e. PIN; pattern; password) once every 72 hours or less OR clearly disclose to the user that some data will not be backed up in order to preserve the privacy of their data. If device implementations add or modify the recommended primary authentication methods to unlock the lock screen and use a new authentication method that is based on biometrics to be treated as a secure way to lock the screen; the new method: [C-4-1] MUST meet all requirements described in section 7.3.10 for Class 1 (formerly Convenience). [C-4-2] MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended primary authentication methods which is based on a known secret. [C-4-3] MUST be disabled and only allow the recommended primary authentication to unlock the screen when the Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the keyguard feature policy by calling the method DevicePolicyManager.setKeyguardDisabledFeatures() ; with any of the associated biometric flags (i.e. KEYGUARD_DISABLE_BIOMETRICS; KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FINGERPRINT; KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FACE; or KEYGUARD_DISABLE_IRIS). If the biometric authentication methods do not meet the requirements for Class 3 (formerly Strong) as described in section 7.3.10: [C-5-1] The methods MUST be disabled if the Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the password quality policy via the DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality() method with a more restrictive quality constant than PASSWORD_QUALITY_BIOMETRIC_WEAK. [C-5-2] The user MUST be challenged for the recommended primary authentication (eg: PIN; pattern; password) as described in [C-1-7] and [C-1-8] in section 7.3.10. [C-5-3] The methods MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen; and MUST meet the requirements that start with C-8 in this section below. If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen and a new authentication method is based on a physical token or the location: [C-6-1] They MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended primary authentication methods which is based on a known secret and meet the requirements to be treated as a secure lock screen. [C-6-2] The new method MUST be disabled and only allow one of the recommended primary authentication methods to unlock the screen when the Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the policy with either the DevicePolicyManager.setKeyguardDisabledFeatures(KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS) method or the DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality() method with a more restrictive quality constant than PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED. [C-6-3] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary authentication methods (e.g.PIN; pattern; password) at least once every 4 hours or less. [C-6-4] The new method MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen and MUST follow the constraints listed in C-8 below. If device implementations have a secure lock screen and include one or more trust agent; which implements the TrustAgentService System API; they: [C-7-1] MUST have clear indication in the settings menu and on the lock screen when device lock is deferred or can be unlocked by trust agent(s). For example; AOSP meets this requirement by showing a text description for the ""Automatically lock setting"" and ""Power button instantly locks"" in the settings menu and a distinguishable icon on the lock screen. [C-7-2] MUST respect and fully implement all trust agent APIs in the DevicePolicyManager class; such as the KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS constant. [C-7-3] MUST NOT fully implement the TrustAgentService.addEscrowToken() function on a device that is used as a primary personal device (e.g. handheld) but MAY fully implement the function on device implementations that are typically shared (e.g. Android Television or Automotive device). [C-7-4] MUST encrypt all stored tokens added by TrustAgentService.addEscrowToken(). [C-7-5] MUST NOT store the encryption key or escrow token on the same device where the key is used. For example; it is allowed for a key stored on a phone to unlock a user account on a TV. For Automotive devices; it is not allowed for the escrow token to be stored on any part of the vehicle. [C-7-6] MUST inform the user about the security implications before enabling the escrow token to decrypt the data storage. [C-7-7] MUST have a fall-back mechanism to use one of the recommended primary authentication methods. [C-7-8] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary authentication (eg: PIN; pattern; password) methods at least once every 72 hours or less unless the safety of the user (e.g. driver distraction) is of concern. [C-7-9] The user MUST be challenged for one of the recommended primary authentication (eg: PIN; pattern; password) methods as described in [C-1-7] and [C-1-8] in section 7.3.10; unless the safety of the user (e.g. driver distraction) is of concern. [C-7-10] MUST NOT be treated as a secure lock screen and MUST follow the constraints listed in C-8 below. [C-7-11] MUST NOT allow TrustAgents on primary personal devices (e.g: handheld) to unlock the device; and can only use them to keep an already unlocked device in the unlocked state for up to a maximum of 4 hours. The default implementation of TrustManagerService in AOSP meets this requirement. [C-7-12] MUST use a cryptographically secure (e.g UKEY2) communication channel to pass the escrow token from the storage device to the target device. If device implementations add or modify the authentication methods to unlock the lock screen that is not a secure lock screen as described above; and use a new authentication method to unlock the keyguard: [C-8-1] The new method MUST be disabled when the Device Policy Controller (DPC) application has set the eest quality policy via the DevicePolicyManager.setPasswordQuality() method with a more restrictive quality constant than PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED.
